Briton Hamilton, crowned world champion for a record-equalling seventh time last time out in Turkey, held off the Red Bulls of Max Verstappen and Alexander Albon to claim his 95th F1 win.
The race was delayed after Grosjean survived a frightening collision with a barrier on the opening lap. He was taken to hospital with suspected fractured ribs and burns to his hands and feet after his crash which was followed by another accident that saw Racing Point driver Lance Stroll rescued from his overturn car.
Lando Norris came home fourth ahead of his McLaren team-mate Carlos Sainz with Pierre Gasly taking sixth for Alpha Tauri and Renault's Daniel Ricciardo seventh.
Hamilton's Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas finished eighth, having suffered a puncture, ahead of Esteban Ocon in the second Renault and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.
Hamilton's victory, his 11th of the season, lifted him 131 points clear of Bottas in the championship, which he has won already.
However, his initial reaction was one of relief for Grosjean. ""It was such a shocking image to see and it shows the amazing job F1 and the FIA have done for him to walk away from something like that.""",['1119_0'],"[""\nMercedes' British driver Lewis Hamilton lifts the trophy on the podium after winning the Bahrain Formula One Grand Prix at the Bahrain International Circuit in the city of Sakhir on Nov 29, 2020.

The newly-crowned seven-time champion cruised to his 11th win this year in his Mercedes with a masterful drive in challenging and chaotic circumstances.
But after securing a record-increasing 95th career victory ahead of Red Bull's Max Verstappen during a late safety car intervention, he was quick to compliment the sport's modern safety standards for saving the Frenchman whose Haas car broke in two on impact before erupting in flames.
""It was such a shocking image to see,"" said Hamilton, who like all of the drivers had a near 90-minute wait for the restart after the horrific opening lap crash. He used the pause to tweet on safety.

SAKHIR, Bahrain: World champion Lewis Hamilton said he was devastated to miss this weekend's Sakhir Grand Prix in Bahrain having tested positive for coronavirus.
Hamilton, who on Sunday won the Bahrain Grand Prix, the first of back-to-back races in the Gulf state, has already secured a record-equalling seventh world championship this season.
""I am devastated that I won't be racing this weekend,"" he said in a statement.
""Since we started the season in June my team and I have been taking all the precautions we possibly can and following the regulations everywhere we have been in order to stay safe.
""Unfortunately, even though I returned three negative results this past week, I woke up yesterday morning with mild symptoms and requested another test which came back positive.
""I have immediately gone into self-isolation for 10 days.""
Hamilton faces a tight race to be able to compete in the season-ending finale in Abu Dhabi the following weekend.
Due to strict COVID-19 rules in Abu Dhabi, all personnel involved in the F1 event must travel from Bahrain on Dec 7.
Yas Island, where the race is being staged on Dec 13, will then effectively be locked down.
""I am gutted not to be able to race this weekend but my priority is to follow the protocols and advice to protect others,"" said Hamilton.
""I am really lucky that I feel OK with only mild symptoms and will do my best to stay fit and healthy.""
Hamilton, 35, sealed his seventh title in Turkey two races ago to equal the all-time record of Michael Schumacher.
LIVING 'LIKE HERMITS'
He then cruised to his 11th win this year and record-increasing 95th victory on Sunday in a race overshadowed by Romain Grosjean's horrific crash, which left the Frenchman receiving hospital treatment for burns after his car exploded in flames after ploughing into a barrier.
""It was such a shocking image to see,"" said Hamilton, who like all of the drivers had a near 90-minute wait for the restart after the opening-lap crash.
Hamilton and teammate Valtteri Bottas were having to ""live like hermits"" earlier this season to avoid COVID-19, revealed Mercedes boss Toto Wolff after the team recorded two positive cases at the Eifel Grand Prix in Germany in October.
Wolff said both drivers were confined to their rooms.
""They are the most restricted of the whole group, of the whole team,"" he said.
""It's certainly not a great situation for them because you need almost to live like a hermit - and that is what they are doing.
""They are at home, they are not going out for dinners and they are not meeting other people. When we do de-briefs, by Zoom or Microsoft Teams, they are not sitting with their engineers in the room.""
Mercedes have yet to name a replacement for Hamilton. The team has two reserve drivers, Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne and Esteban Gutierrez of Mexico.
Vandoorne, who raced for McLaren during the 2017 and 2018 seasons, is currently in Valencia for Formula E pre-season testing. He had already been due to fly to Bahrain before Hamilton's positive test, a team spokesperson said.

The French driver's car exploded into a fireball after crashing on the first lap and slicing through a metal barrier along the track on Sunday (Dec 29). Grosjean was trapped inside the Haas car's flaming wreckage but escaped in scenes that drew awe and admiration around the world.
""There's going to be some psychological work to be done, because I really saw death coming. When you see images, not even Hollywood is capable of doing that,"" Grosjean told French broadcaster TF1 on Tuesday from his hospital bed in Bahrain.
""To come out of the flames that day is something that will mark my life forever.""
Grosjean was estimated to be inside the raging furnace for nearly 30 seconds but was lucid enough to figure a way out of a near-death situation.
""I don't know if the word miracle exists or it can be used, but it wasn't my time. It did seem much longer than 28 seconds. I saw my visor turning all orange, the flames on the left side of the car,"" he said.

Saudi and Qatar are locked in a bitter dispute after an alliance of countries led by Riyadh cut diplomatic, economic and transport ties with Doha in 2017, accusing it of backing radical Islamists and Iran.

Ahead of the vote, the OCA's president said he was seeking a ""win-win"" situation for Doha and Riyadh.
Doha hosted the Asian Games in 2006 while Saudi Arabia has never organised an OCA multi-sport event.

The Australian race in Melbourne, initially set to open the season on Mar 21, has been rescheduled to Nov 21, with F1 organisers on Tuesday (Jan 12) citing “the ongoing situation regarding COVID-19”. 
The Chinese Grand Prix has also been postponed, but no new date has been set for the race. 
Strict travel restrictions for the pandemic make Australia and China among the hardest countries for F1 teams to enter.
The season will start with the Bahrain Grand Prix on Mar 28 at Sakhir, less than four months after the same venue held two races as part of the 2020 season.
A race has been added at the Imola track in Italy on Apr 18, a week after the scheduled date for the Chinese GP. There is a vacant slot on May 2, with the Portimao circuit in Portugal among the leading candidates for that weekend.
“Discussions with the promoter and authorities in China are ongoing with the potential to reschedule the race later in the season if possible.” F1 said in a statement.
There is no obvious back-up date in the calendar. Races in the second half of the season are organised back-to-back in three-week blocks, putting heavy strain on team staff.
Postponing the Australian GP already means pushing back the end of the season in Abu Dhabi by a week to Dec 12. The calendar stays at 23 races, the most ever.
Martin Pakula, the minister for tourism and major events in the Victorian state government which backs the Melbourne race, said it was a sensible decision which potentially could mean international fans attending. That's only if Australia's borders reopen in time.
“This is the right decision and we thank Formula 1 management for their cooperation in setting a new schedule,” he said. “The Formula 1 Australian Grand Prix is one of the great events in the world and we’ll make sure it can be run safely and successfully in November.”
The pandemic has disrupted the F1 season two years running. Last year's race in Australia was cancelled after one team member tested positive for the coronavirus. Fans were preparing to enter the circuit for Friday practice when organisers announced the cancellation.
That started a cascade of postponements and cancellations which meant the rescheduled 2020 season didn't start until July. There was a compressed 17-race schedule through December with all races in Europe or the Middle East.

In Tokyo, organisers of this year's rescheduled Olympics have insisted the Games will go ahead, but infectious diseases experts question the safety of hosting it before the coronavirus is comprehensively defeated, and speculation is rife that they could be called off.
If the Olympics fall, the 2022 World Cup being staged in the Middle East for the first time would be the next major global sporting event to face scrutiny of its virus strategy and safety plans.
""Qatar started this matter gradually by hosting matches for the AFC Champions League without fans,"" said Yasir al-Jamal, chairman of the Operations Office of Qatar's Supreme Committee charged with organising the 2022 tournament.
""Then in December, capacity was raised to 30 per cent which was followed by the Club World Cup at the same percentage ... then reaching the 2022 World Cup with crowds of 100 per cent,"" he told AFP on Sunday (Feb 7).
Qatar is currently hosting the Club World Cup of regional champions as the country sees a spike in COVID-19 cases and hospital admissions.
Local authorities have taken a swathe of measures including banning travelling fans from outside the country.
New cases over the past week jumped by a fifth compared to the week before, according to official data, while hospital admissions due to COVID-19 are up 85 per cent in the past month, the health ministry said.
""There is confidence in the measures that are taken in the stadiums and the metro network and in the means of entry and exit to preserve the safety of everyone,"" Jamal said.
Qatar officially cut the maximum permitted capacity at open-air football grounds to 20 per cent ahead of the club tournament, but the competition was permitted to continue with maximum 30 per cent attendance.
""We have put in place several precautionary measures to ensure that 30 per cent is appropriate,"" Jamal said.
Matches are being played at two stadiums which will also host World Cup games next year.
Qatar has so far inaugurated three new grounds and opened one refurbished venue with four yet to be opened.
Two of the as-yet unopened stadiums, Al Thumama and Ras Abu Abboud, could be used for the 22-nation Arab Cup competition in December, Jamal said.
""It is up to FIFA, but we hope that the Arab Cup will represent a golden opportunity to test the two stadiums,"" he said.

Formula One said in a statement the date of the Miami race had yet to be decided.
Miami will be the 11th location Formula One has raced at in the United States since the world championship started in 1950.
""The US is a key growth market for us and we are greatly encouraged by our growing reach in the US which will be further supported by this exciting second race,"" said Formula One chief executive Stefano Domenicali.

Liberty Media-owned Formula One has targeted Miami as a venue for some time but faced strong local opposition from residents worried about excessive noise and air pollution.
In 2019, Formula One and local organisers abandoned plans to hold the race in the downtown area and put forward a revised layout winding around the Hard Rock Stadium.
The Hard Rock Stadium belongs to real estate mogul and Dolphins owner Stephen Ross, who will fund construction of the track and cover race costs.
""The Hard Rock stadium entertainment campus in Miami Gardens exists to host the biggest global events to benefit the entire greater Miami region and Formula One racing is as big as it gets,"" said Miami GP managing partner Tom Garfinkel.
""We have worked with specialist designers to create a racetrack that we, Formula One and the FIA believe will provide great racing.""

Red Bull's Verstappen suffered a left-rear failure on the straight while leading towards the end of the June 6 race in Baku.
Aston Martin's Canadian Lance Stroll had earlier crashed out with a similar failure.
Sole supplier Pirelli on Tuesday ruled out any production or quality defects and accepted the teams had followed prescribed parameters when the tyres were fitted.
It indicated that how the tyres were then run had contributed to the incidents.
Asked at the French Grand Prix if he was happy with Pirelli's explanation, the 23-year-old Dutch driver replied: ""Personally not.
""I think the team did everything like they should have done, they followed all the guidelines with tyre pressures at the start.
""For sure we'll go up on pressures here for this weekend. 100per cent sure we will. Probably it has something to do with that, what happened in Baku, but it would also be nice to know if it was tyre pressure-related. Just speak out.
""That would be a bit easier to understand than the explanation we got so far.""
Pirelli had said in their statement that the cause was due to ""a circumferential break on the inner sidewall, which can be related to the running conditions of the tyre.""
Verstappen said he felt fortunate to have escaped unhurt from the crash.
""I was actually quite lucky to hit the wall on the right hand side, instead of the left. I think if I would have gone left it would have been a really big impact,"" he said.
Seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton said safety was the priority and Pirelli and the governing FIA needed to do a better job in policing tyre pressures and temperatures during the race as well as before.
""Whenever there is a failure they always put the pressures up, so that tells you something,"" said the Mercedes driver. ""More often than not the tyres are not running at the pressures that have been asked.
""I think they've done a great job with the tyres this year, they are more robust than before.
""In this particular instance I don’t think Pirelli are at fault.""

Hamilton revealed after the Jun 6 race in Baku that he had accidentally hit the button at the re-start, leaving him without rear brakes into the first corner and sending him off track and from second to 15th.
Red Bull's championship leader Max Verstappen had already crashed out and Hamilton, attempting to pass the Dutch driver's team mate Sergio Perez for the race win, had been set to regain the overall lead.
""We've just put a shroud around it to make sure that I can't accidentally touch it in future,"" the Briton told reporters at the French Grand Prix.
""That's for the short term. Obviously the wheel's not so easy to change or to move buttons. We'll look for a longer term solution.""
Hamilton said after the race in Baku that what happened had been a stroke of bad luck.
""It definitely wasn't any pressure from Max and I don't even count it as a mistake,"" he said on Thursday. ""I don't feel any pressure, I feel pretty relaxed.
""You can't always be perfect. A mistake is when you often drive off the track through missing your braking point or hitting the wall.
""It was kind of an unforced error, really just something that we had that was sitting there that could have happened at any point. It unfortunately bit us pretty hard but you learn from the experience.""
Hamilton is four points behind Verstappen after six races, despite having won three of them.
Baku was the champion's second big mistake of the season after sliding off track and nudging the barriers in Imola in April before the race was stopped, throwing him a lifeline. He ended up second.
The most successful Formula One driver of all time has taken just seven points from the last two street races in Monaco and Baku but should be on happier territory at Le Castellet this weekend.

The Finn has not scored a point from the last two races, although a blank in Monaco was due to the team being unable to remove a wheel, and has dropped to sixth overall in the standings with 47 points.
Seven-times world champion team mate Lewis Hamilton, second overall, has won three races and scored 54 points more than Bottas after six rounds.
""You can't always block the noise that is around, and every season is the same thing, the same questions and the same speculation. It's part of the sport,"" Bottas told reporters ahead of the French Grand Prix.
""We haven't really yet discussed anything about the contract with Mercedes, and that will come eventually,"" he said, adding that he had not devoted much thought to any 'Plan B'.
Bottas is out of contract at the end of the season and some media reports have suggested he had already been told it would not be extended, with Britain's George Russell set to move from Williams.
The Finn said he spoke often with team boss and shareholder Toto Wolff but what had been reported was not true.
""That's speculation and I'm sure there is all kind of speculation that is not based on any facts,"" he added.
""People are trying to make up stories just for the clicks. That's how it goes.""
Asked what his 'gut feeling' was about his future, Bottas replied: ""I haven't really allowed myself to think about that too much because that can become a distraction.
""It will come at some point. So for now the gut is not saying anything.""

The sport wants to host three sprint races in 2021, with the first at Silverstone in July and the second scheduled for Monza in September.
The venue for the third has yet to be decided, with the United States in October and Brazil in November mentioned as the most likely candidates. Both have hosted title-deciding races in the past.
Under the new format, qualifying will switch to Friday with points awarded on Saturday to the top three drivers in a short 40 minute race to decide Sunday's starting grid.
Those extra points could, in theory, be enough to clinch the title although the current battle between Mercedes' seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen looks like going the distance.
The pair are so far separated by just four points after six rounds.
""We'd probably want to avoid the title being decided on a Saturday,"" Brawn told reporters in a briefing ahead of Sunday's French Grand Prix.
""If we went to the last race and a driver could win the championship on Saturday by winning a sprint event, that could bring an added dimension but I think we'll just try to avoid it while we find out how successful it is.
""We want to pick an event ideally a few races before the end of the season and we always want to pick tracks where we think the racing can take place in a short format with overtaking opportunities and a little bit of tyre degradation.
""I don't think we want to do it at the last race.""
Brawn said he understood purists might be unhappy with the proposed change but he urged them to hold judgement and give the format a chance.
He said the sprint race would give promoters and broadcasters more of a show with three meaningful days as well as potentially appeal to a new and younger audience of fans.
Brawn likened it to short-format cricket compared to Test matches, saying the former had attracted new fans for the traditional offering.
""We will never force this through if it's clearly not a success,"" he promised. ""There's no incentive in doing it if the audience don't engage.
""I think one of the great things about what's happening is that it's three races, it's not the season...If we don't get the response we hope, then we'll put our hands up and stay the way we are.""

Red Bull's world championship leader Max Verstappen and Aston Martin's Lance Stroll both suffered blowouts during the June 6 race in Baku, fortunately without injury. Verstappen's cost the Dutchman a race win.
Pirelli has indicated both teams were running the tyres on lower pressures than expected, while respecting the manufacturer's starting parameters and not doing anything illegal.
Lower tyre pressures bring more grip and increased performance.
A technical directive (TD) has been issued ahead of this weekend's French Grand Prix with the minimum tyre pressures boosted.
""It was a very interesting sequence of events this week with the TD coming out and seeing the carefully chosen words in the press releases and in the statements from all parties involved,"" said McLaren team boss Andreas Seidl.
""What is a bit disappointing for us is that there is not more transparency in what actually happened because it was a safety-critical topic, what happened there in Baku, and normally in cases like that there is transparency.""
Seidl said the regulations had been clear before Baku and there was a reason why Pirelli issued teams with minimum tyre pressures.
Asked what specifically he needed to know, Seidl said a lot of assumptions had been made about what actually happened.
""There's a lot of criticism up in the air also towards Pirelli but in the end that's not something we would support from our side because I think Pirelli has produced a safe product for this year,"" he added.
""In Baku, if you were running the car within the regulations and following the prescriptions from Pirelli there was no issue with the tyres.""

""I know some of them have been on the simulator trying to beat one of my lap times that I did at Brands. I don't think any of them have yet. I know Mason said he was trying hard to beat me,"" he said.

Norris, a keen player as a kid and a casual Bristol City fan, said he followed England when major tournaments were on but otherwise did not watch much.
With a Belgian mother and a German team boss, Norris was looking forward also to some friendly rivalry.
""If my mom asks me who I'm supporting then I'll say Belgium. So I'm split. I would love both of them to do well,"" he grinned.

After two tough street races for the reigning champions, Mercedes are hoping for a return to winning ways at a southern circuit they have dominated since its return to the calendar in 2018.
Seven-times world champion Hamilton won from pole position in 2018 and 2019 and Mercedes have also led every practice session.
Bottas topped the timesheets in one minute 33.448 seconds, with Hamilton 0.335 slower and Red Bull's championship leader Max Verstappen third with a lap of 1:33.880 and Azerbaijan GP-winning team mate Sergio Perez fourth.
Verstappen is four points clear of Hamilton after six rounds.
Alpine's Esteban Ocon was fifth and McLaren's Daniel Ricciardo sixth with Alpine's double world champion Fernando Alonso seventh.
Neither Ferrari made the top 10, with Charles Leclerc 11th and Carlos Sainz 16th.
Several drivers, including Bottas, damaged their cars and tyres on the kerbs and brightly painted abrasive run-off areas.
Aston Martin's Sebastian Vettel hit the barriers backwards and nursed his damaged car back to the pits, a set of tyres wrecked.

The Finn finished a frustrated fourth in a French Grand Prix won by Red Bull's Max Verstappen, whose gamble on stopping twice paid off while Mercedes paid the price for staying out on fading tyres.
""Why...does no one listen to me when I say it's going to be a two-stopper?!,"" Bottas, whose contract is up at the end of the season, said in a radio outburst featuring several expletives.
Bottas had failed to score in the previous two races in Monaco and Azerbaijan and the failure to defend at least a podium place hurt.
""I think the winning strategy today was two stop. Easy to say afterwards but that's how it is,"" he said. ""I think as a team we're too focused on just completing the one stop, thinking it's the best. But it wasn't.
""I had no front tyres left for the last 10-15 laps so it was really just trying to get the car home. It was not fun today, the last stint.
""If I did a two stop, for sure I would have been on the podium and fighting for the win.""
Red Bull's Sergio Perez, on fresher tyres after a later stop than Bottas, took third in the closing laps.
Bottas had plenty of margin towards the end to pit without losing position, and have a shot at taking fastest lap from Verstappen, but Mercedes kept him out so he also missed out on that bonus point.
Team boss Toto Wolff said that was because it looked like Perez might collect a penalty for overtaking outside of the track limits and they wanted Bottas to remain within five seconds of the Mexican.
In the end, stewards decided not to punish Perez.

The Briton had won at Le Castellet in 2018 and 2019, with no race last year due to COVID-19, but his hopes of a hat-trick ended when resurgent Red Bull out-smarted the champions on strategy.
The seventh race of the season was a reversal of the Spanish Grand Prix in May when Hamilton hunted down Verstappen, who said then that he felt like a sitting duck, in the closing laps to win.
This time it was the champion who was on the receiving end as Verstappen made a second pitstop and used his fresher tyres to make up the time and overhaul Hamilton on the penultimate lap.
Asked how gut-wrenching the feeling had been, Hamilton - now 12 points behind his Dutch rival - said it had not been at all.
""I think we did a great job today and it just didn't work out,"" he added.
""I'm not massively disappointed. I think I did the best job I could today. Of course, there were things we could probably have done slightly better but overall they have been quicker than us all weekend.
""It's a true reflection of the pace they have.""
Hamilton had arrived at Le Castellet having scored just seven points from the previous two races won by Red Bull and lagging Verstappen by four.
The 36-year-old recognised that another chance to win had e slipped through his fingers, his tally still stuck at a record 98 career victories.
""If we look in hindsight for sure if we'd have stopped earlier, before they stopped and come out ahead and just gone onto a two stop, we probably could have won the race,"" he said.
""But it would still have been very difficult. Their pace was generally very, very strong.
""If he (Verstappen) had not made a mistake in turn one, they would have just led the race all the way probably.""
Verstappen started on pole but went wide at the start, allowing Hamilton to take the lead which the Mercedes driver held until the pitstops, when the Dutch driver got back in front before taking a gamble and pitting again.
""Lewis's tyres were really worn,"" Verstappen said of the closing stages. ""It was a fairly easy pass.""",['798_0'],"[""\nRed Bull's Max Verstappen celebrates on the podium after winning the race alongside second placed Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton. (Photo: Pool via REUTERS/Nicolas Tucat)\n""]"

Polesitter Newgarden had looked poised to give Team Penske their first win of the season until his car, with two laps to run, suddenly lost power during a restart following a late caution, allowing Palou to shoot past him into the lead and gifting the young Spaniard and Chip Ganassi Racing the win.
Colton Herta took second for Andretti Autosport ahead of Penske's Will Power.
Reigning series champion Scott Dixon of New Zealand was fourth while Grosjean continued to shine in his maiden IndyCar season, the Frenchman finishing fifth for his second top-five result in the last four races.
The second win of the season for Palou moved him to the top of the IndyCar drivers championship, 28 points in front of Mexico's Pato O'Ward, another of IndyCar's emerging young drivers with two wins this season.
Grosjean and Magnussen, who for four years were team mates at Haas before both were let go by the F1 outfit at the end of last season, were reunited at the Wisconsin track.
While Grosjean is running a full season with Dale Coyne Racing and already has a second-place finish, Magnussen made his IndyCar debut, filling in for Felix Rosenqvist at Arrow McLaren after the Swede was injured in crash last Saturday in Detroit.

The ABSOLUTE BASICS
Road cycling is split into two events for each gender - a road race and a time trial.
The men's race will see 130 participants, with a maximum team size of five, battling over a 234km course. Meanwhile, 67 women will race over 137km with an elevation gain over 2,692m.
Both individual time trials are solo races against the clock.
HOW MANY MEDALS?
Four gold medals are up for grabs - one each for men and women in road cycling and individual time trial events respectively.
WHAT HAPPENED IN RIO?
Dutch rider Anna van Vleuten suffered a horror crash while leading the women's race, allowing team mate Anna van der Breggen to claim gold.
Belgian Greg Van Avermaet outsprinted his rivals to win the men's race after pre-race favourite Vincenzo Nibali broke his collarbones in another high-speed crash.
In the women's time trial, American Kristin Armstrong became the first cyclist to take gold in the same road event at three different Olympic Games.
WHAT CAN WE EXPECT FROM TOKYO?
Reigning world champion Julian Alaphilippe has decided to skip the Games and Gio d'Italia winner Egan Bernal is an injury doubt, leaving Slovenia duo Primoz Roglic and Tadej Pogacar as the medal contenders in the men's races.
In the women's races, it will be hard to look beyond the Dutch all-star line-up of Marianne Vos, Van der Breggen and Van Vleuten. Their biggest challenge in the time trial should come from American Chloe Dygert, who aims to compete in both track and road events.
WHAT'S NEW?
The races will end at the picturesque Fuji International Speedway, which hosted a number of Formula One races in the past.
WHEN IS IT HAPPENING?
Road races: Jul 24-25.
Individual time trial events: Jul 28.
WHERE IS IT HAPPENING?
Both the men's and women's road races will start in eastern Tokyo at Musashinonomori Park before finishing at the Fuji International Speedway motor racing circuit located at the foot of Mount Fuji.
The time trials will heavily feature the racing circuit, while also take the riders through countryside nearby.
HOW DID WE GET HERE?
According to a popular legend, the first-ever bike race was held over a 1,200m course in Paris in 1868.
The sport went on to make its Olympic debut in 1896 and road events have been ever-present on the programme since the Stockholm 1912 Games.

Sunday's (Jun 20) race at Le Castellet was the first time Ferrari had failed to score this year, with Spaniard Carlos Sainz 11th and Monegasque Charles Leclerc 16th.
They had qualified fifth and seventh respectively, with Leclerc on pole at the two previous races in Monaco and Azerbaijan, but Ferrari ended the weekend dropping from third to fourth overall in the constructors' championship.
""We have not been capable of making the tyres work as we should have done and I think our performance was really strictly linked to the tyres, the way we made them work,"" Binotto told reporters.
Le Castellet did not host a race last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic but Binotto said hot conditions and high speed corners putting a lot of energy into the tyres had been a problem in the past.
""We should have addressed it and it’s not yet the case,"" said Binotto. ""Looking at the future it's important for us as a lesson learned.""
He said it would take more than development of the current car to fix the problem, however.
""To solve it, I think we need to have some hardware change, like for example the rims, which is not possible for regulations,"" said the Italian.
""I think it's more important for us to try to understand and to address it definitively for next year. In the meanwhile I think that this issue will happen again at some races but not on all the tracks.""
Sainz, who joined the team this year from McLaren, said the team tended to struggle more in races than in qualifying but there had been some where race pace was not an issue.
""It's really clear that we have a very narrow window of working range on our front tyres and we tend to struggle a lot more with graining and front wear than our competitors,"" said the Spaniard.

Bordeaux were placed into administration in April after their owners, investment management firm King Street Capital Management, decided they could no longer support the club financially.
The former French champions have been struggling financially due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the premature end to the 2019-20 season also resulted in a loss of income when the league season was cancelled.
Their problems were compounded when Spanish media rights agency Mediapro, which had won TV rights for a record 780 million euros (US$936.23 million) per season over the 2020-24 period, missed payments last year.
The club on Tuesday said former Lotus Formula One team president Lopez agreed a deal with the U.S. owners and creditors Fortress Investment Group and they will now need an approval from the league's National Directorate of Management Control.
Lopez's deal comes after he sold French club Lille to Callisto Sporting, a subsidiary of Luxembourg-based investment fund Merlyn Partners last December.

McLaren's Daniel Ricciardo was second fastest, on a cloudy but mostly dry afternoon at Spielberg's scenic Red Bull Ring, and Alpine's Esteban Ocon third.
Mercedes' seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton, 12 points behind Verstappen after seven races in a tough title battle, ended up fourth on the timesheets and said it was ""a work in progress"".

""I think the Red Bulls definitely will be really hard to beat, I think they've just got the edge - maybe more. We don't know what they're going to do when they turn that engine up.""
The Briton went faster than Verstappen in the second stint but his lap time was wiped for exceeding the track limits at the last corner when he went wide.
""Lewis was faster but his lap time got deleted so it looks a bit different than what is shown at the moment,"" said Verstappen, a two times winner in Austria.
""But overall it has been quite good for us. Of course a few things to look into but I'm quite happy where the car is at the moment.""
Bottas, fourth and 12th, was summoned to stewards after losing rear grip and skidding sideways as he left the Mercedes pits, coming to a halt blocking the pit lane but without hitting anybody.
""That's absolutely ridiculous,"" said McLaren in a radio message to race director Michael Masi. ""He could have taken our guys out there.""
Bottas, who said he had tried ""something different"" in getting out of the box, was also given two penalty points for potentially dangerous driving.
Alpine's Fernando Alonso was fifth in the afternoon, with Aston Martin's Sebastian Vettel sixth and McLaren's Lando Norris seventh.
Frenchman Pierre Gasly had been second for AlphaTauri in the first session but sat out the afternoon due to power unit problems.
Sunday's race will be the first of two at Spielberg's scenic Red Bull Ring, with fans in attendance after racing behind closed doors last year.
Red Bull are chasing their fourth successive victory after winning in Monaco, Azerbaijan and France. The team last won four in a row in 2013, before the V6 turbo hybrid era ushered in seven years of Mercedes domination from 2014.

The governing FIA issued a technical directive to teams before the weekend's Styrian Grand Prix in Austria to clarify the rules and prevent the use of automated systems during pitstops.
New controls will be enforced from the Hungarian Grand Prix in August.
Red Bull hold the record for the quickest pitstop at 1.82 seconds and regularly manage to change all four tyres in less than two seconds - a time considerably faster than rivals Mercedes usually achieve.
""If you can't be beaten then obviously the most logical thing is for your competitors to try to slow you down, and that's obviously what's happening here,"" Red Bull team boss Christian Horner told reporters.
Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff revealed that his team had asked the FIA some three or four weeks ago about a safety mechanism related to a system they were using and asking if it could be optimised.
""Did that trigger anything else? Maybe. I don’t know,"" added the Austrian.
Horner said teams already had a duty to ensure their cars were safe as they left the pitlane and the penalties for a wheel not being fixed were 'brutal'.
""What the technical directive is trying to achieve, I’m not quite sure because I think there’s an awful lot of complexity to it,"" he said.
""I think you can see there’s an awful lot of pointed activity in our direction at the moment – but that comes with the territory of being competitive.""
Red Bull's Max Verstappen is 12 points clear of Mercedes' seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton while the team are 37 points clear in the constructors' standings.
Mercedes have had several glaringly slow pitstops, most notably when they failed to remove a jammed wheel from Valtteri Bottas's car until the Tuesday after the Monaco Grand Prix.
Horner said there had been previous discussions and directives on pitstop procedures and the latest was not well thought through.
""To have to hold a car for two tenths of a second I think you could almost argue that it is dangerous because you are judging your gaps and the guy releasing the car is having to make that judgement,"" he said.
""Formula One is about innovation and competition and seeing pit stops in sub-two seconds is a remarkable feat and we should be encouraging it, not trying to control it.
""Otherwise, where does it stop? We’re going to be told which way we should walk into the garage, where we should sit on the pit wall and which buttons we should press, I guess.""

Stewards also gave the Finn two penalty points for the incident during the day's second session.
""When (Bottas) pulled away from his designated pit stop position, he lost control of the car when he turned into the fast lane,"" the stewards' report said.
""He oversteered, spun and came to a stop across the fast lane near the McLaren pits.
""During the hearing (Bottas) stated that in the past they have been losing time in the pit departure. So they tried something new, which was to leave in second gear. As a result, the wheel spin was much higher and the result unexpected.""
The stewards said the incident had to be considered potentially dangerous driving, given the presence of personnel in the pit lane.
Bottas has failed to finish on the podium in the last three races and is fifth overall in the championship, having scored half the points of seven-times world champion team mate Lewis Hamilton.
The Finn's contract is up at the end of the season. He had said earlier he would be surprised to get a penalty for a ""normal mistake"".
The drop is a blow for Mercedes as they fight a tight battle with Red Bull, who are 37 points clear in the constructors' standings afters even races.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen is 12 points clear of Hamilton.

Verstappen led from start to finish at Austria's Red Bull Ring, with seven-times world champion Hamilton second for Mercedes.
The Briton was 35.743 seconds behind at the chequered flag after a late stop for fresh tyres to bag a bonus point for fastest lap.
It was the first time since 2013 that mighty Mercedes, champions for the past seven years, had gone four races in a row without a win and the first time since then that Red Bull had celebrated four successive victories.
""Unbelievable. The car was on fire today,"" said Verstappen over the team radio after the 23-year-old Dutch driver's fourth win in eight races this season, second in a row and 14th of his career.
""You never know how it's going to end up but straight away I felt a good balance in the car,"" he added after stepping out of the car.
Valtteri Bottas was third for Mercedes, just holding off Verstappen's Mexican team mate Sergio Perez who had fresher tyres after making a second stop in a bid for fastest lap.
The Finn had benefited from a slow pitstop for Perez to put himself on the podium after starting fifth due to a grid penalty.
Everybody else was lapped by Verstappen, who started on pole and has now won more races than anyone else this year as Red Bull emerge as the biggest threat to Mercedes since the start of the V6 turbo hybrid era in 2014.
""That is the most dominant win we've had so far this year,"" said Red Bull team boss Christian Horner.
Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said it was the first race in eight years that Mercedes, who have shifted their focus to next year's big rule changes, had been simply lacking pace.
""We have stopped developing for this year because we believe the next years are so important to get it right and they (Red Bull) keep adding bits,"" he said.
""We just have to get the best out of the package that we have and this is far from over.""
LONELY RACE
Red Bull are now 40 points ahead of Mercedes in the constructors' championship.
""It was a bit of a lonely race really,"" said Hamilton, who started on the front row but never challenged for the lead.
""I was trying to keep up with those guys but the speed they have, they've obviously made some big improvements over the last couple of races and it's impossible to keep up,"" added the Briton.
""It feels like we lose a lot down the straights.""
As a footnote, his second place equalled Ferrari great Michael Schumacher's all-time record of 43 runner-up positions.
The scenic Spielberg circuit hosts another race next weekend, the Austrian Grand Prix, with a much bigger crowd expected after a restricted 15,000 attendance on Sunday.
McLaren's Lando Norris finished fifth with Ferrari's Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc sixth and seventh respectively as the team battle for third place overall tightened.
Canadian Lance Stroll was eighth for Aston Martin, ahead of Alpine's Fernando Alonso and Japanese rookie Yuki Tsunoda taking the final point for AlphaTauri.
There was dismay at Williams, with George Russell starting 10th and running solidly in the points until he retired with a power unit issue after making three stops.
The race lacked wheel-to-wheel drama at the front, and there were no crashes or need for safety cars either.
AlphaTauri's Pierra Gasly was the first retirement after a first lap contact with Leclerc, who had to pit for a new front wing.

As Red Bull celebrated a fourth straight win on Sunday to stretch their leads in both championships, with Max Verstappen 18 points clear of Hamilton, Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff ruled out upgrades.
""We have stopped developing for this year because we believe the next years are so important to get right,"" said the Austrian, whose team have won every championship for the past seven seasons, at the Styrian Grand Prix.
Major changes in 2022 could see a big shift in the pecking order - the last rules revolution in 2014, with the V6 turbo hybrid engine, ushered in an unprecedented period of Mercedes domination.
Sunday's race at Austria's Red Bull Ring was the first time since 2013 that Mercedes had suffered four straight defeats and Red Bull enjoyed four successive wins.
""We are having new regulations not only for next year but for years to come, a completely different car concept, and you’ve got to choose the right balance,"" Wolff told reporters.
""It would make no sense to put a week or two or a month back on the current car, because the gains wouldn’t be anywhere near the gains we are making on the 2022 car.
""Having said that, this is far from over,"" he added.
""We will be winning races this season, and we will be having pole positions, and we will be fighting as much as we can for every single result.""
Hamilton said Mercedes lacked straight line speed but there was not a lot the team could do with another race next weekend at the same Red Bull Ring.
He said they would ""work as hard as we can to see if we can squeeze any more juice out of this car.""
""Naturally I would love to have upgrades and improvements but I don't think that's currently on the cards,"" he added. ""When we do a debrief we'll chat about it but that's how it is at the moment.""
Hamilton said the team would keep pushing as ever.
""We're the world champions and we can definitely improve if we put our minds to it,"" he said.
""But if we're not going to develop and improve our car for the rest of the year, this is the result you are going to see.""

The 23-year-old Dutch driver slowed by his team's pitwall as he took the chequered flag at Austria's Red Bull Ring, a home circuit for his team, and laid down some rubber before accelerating away.
The location of the action, and with the rest of the field still racing flat out to the finish, did not impress Masi who said he followed it up immediately.
""It was not an ideal situation, which is why I spoke to the team immediately and told them accordingly that it’s something that would not be tolerated in future,"" said Masi.
Formula One's sporting regulations say the winning driver may perform an act of celebration providing it is carried out safely and without endangering officials or other drivers.
The same circuit hosts the Austrian Grand Prix next weekend, and Verstappen will be favourite to bring Red Bull a fifth successive win.

The talk since the start of the season has been of a wheel-to-wheel title duel down to the wire between Mercedes' seven- times champion and Verstappen, the 23-year-old Dutch heir apparent.
That perception could change if Verstappen follows up last weekend's crushing pole to flag Styrian Grand Prix victory at his team's home Spielberg circuit with more of the same.
Mercedes, dominant since the start of the V6 turbo hybrid era in 2014, have lost their winning feeling.
Hamilton has spoken out about the need for upgrades and more speed and the big question is how Mercedes respond to the challenge.
Verstappen is 18 points clear after eight races, still a sufficiently small lead for one retirement to wipe it out completely, while Red Bull are 40 points ahead in the constructors' standings.
A fifth win of the season for the Dutchman, and third victory in a row, could put him out of immediate range, however.
It would also put the championship in a different light because nobody since McLaren in 2005 has taken five straight wins and not won the constructors' title.
Consistency has been more of a strong point for Mercedes than Red Bull in the recent past but the Honda engine has been holding up well and the leaders keep bringing new parts to their car while Mercedes have switched focus to 2022.
""What looked to be the better car is now showing it in the results,"" Formula One's managing director for motorsport Ross Brawn sad of Red Bull after Sunday's race.
""At the beginning of the year, Mercedes out-raced them. That is not the case now. It’s been the opposite in the last couple of races. Mercedes are trying too hard, and they’ve stumbled a bit.""
Red Bull team boss Christian Horner was clear about what his team needed to do.
""Max is, I think, driving with great maturity and consistency and we've just got to keep turning the screw and just keep our heads down, keep doing what we're doing and just keep doing the basics well,"" he said.
Behind the top two, McLaren and Ferrari are battling for third place.
McLaren's Lando Norris will be chasing his eighth top-five finish in nine races while Australian team mate Daniel Ricciardo needs to raise his game after a difficult start to his time at the Woking team.
Further down the grid, Willams' George Russell has an immediate chance to fix last weekend's disappointment of having to retire after starting 10th and looking good for the former champions' first point in nearly two years.

The series will be titled Lucky! and has been given exclusive rights by British billionaire Ecclestone, who was replaced by Formula One's US-based owners Liberty Media in 2017 and is now 90.
It will also use extensive archive footage provided by Formula One.
""Bernie has been able to reflect, not just on his days as one of the greatest sporting impresarios of all time, but also on his life,"" said Pandey, who will write and direct, in a statement.

The 36-year-old Briton, 18 points behind Red Bull's Max Verstappen after eight races, told reporters at the Austrian Grand Prix on Thursday he was staying positive.
""I don’t really find myself being concerned as such,"" he said of the title battle.
""We're all pushing as hard as we can, of course we'd love to have more pace at the moment to be able to really challenge, not only in qualifying but in the race.

Head of Trackside Engineering Andrew Shovlin revealed at last weekend's Styrian Grand Prix, won by Verstappen and held at the same Red Bull Ring, that Hamilton had been doing a lot of work in the simulator.
The driver posted another picture of it on social media on Wednesday.
That marks quite a departure for the Briton who said at the Spanish Grand Prix in May, after taking his 100th career pole position, that he did about 20 laps a year in the simulator.
""I can’t say that I’m necessarily enjoying it,"" Hamilton said. ""Particularly after those few difficult races we had, I went in to try and see if there’s any way I could try and help the team just be better prepared.
""I think there’s been a couple of good things from it, but not life changing,"" added the champion, who won three races before Red Bull secured four wins in a row with Verstappen and Mexican Sergio Perez.
That was a first for the V6 turbo hybrid era that Mercedes, now 40 points behind Red Bull in the constructors' standings, have dominated.
""I’ll continue to work with them ... just working on the processes of how we communicate with them (the test drivers) on their programme, so we’re getting the right things tested,"" said Hamilton.

The Spaniard was asked at the Austrian Grand Prix on Thursday what was behind his decision to do track inspection walks this year after not doing them much in the past.
Some drivers and engineers like to walk around the circuit on the Thursday morning before it is closed, looking out for any changes.
""I did one in Portimao this year because it was a new circuit,"" Alonso replied, referring to the Portuguese Grand Prix track. ""It was the best weekend and we scored good points and felt competitive there.
""We stopped doing it in Barcelona and in Monaco and we came back to not scoring points. So we said OK, we'll try again in Baku.
""We finished sixth, so it was our best race, and from that moment we keep doing track walks and keep scoring points on Sundays."" he added.
""At the moment it's a pure superstitious thing.""
Alonso has scored points in the last three races - Azerbaijan, France and the Styrian GP in Austria - to go 11th in the championship. He finished 17th in Spain and 13th in Monaco.
The Spaniard was joined in the news conference by Red Bull's championship leader Max Verstappen, who has won four of eight races this season and is going for his third win in a row in Austria on Sunday.
The Dutch 23-year-old told reporters before last month's Azerbaijan Grand Prix that he would rather stay in bed than do a track walk.

Red Bull's long-serving head of aerodynamics Dan Fallows was announced last week as Aston Martin's new technical director in a move likely to take some time to complete due to contractual ties.
Alessi, who has started work at Aston Martin, will oversee the design, planning, production and operations of the aerodynamics department.
Silverstone-based Aston Martin, owned by Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll, are ramping up recruitment as they prepare to move to a new factory in 2022 and expand to compete with the sport's big teams.
They also recently announced the signing of Alfa Romeo's chief designer Luca Furbatto.
""Many times this year we have said: ‘This team has always punched above its weight; now it has the weight with which to punch harder’,"" said team boss Otmar Szafnauer.

Germany's four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel, who won four titles with Red Bull from 2010 to 2013, moved to Aston Martin from Ferrari at the end of last season.
Alessi and Fallows both worked with him at Red Bull but Vettel felt their arrival was more a reflection of geography than any desire to get the band back together.
""The team has been growing since longer than I have been part of it, and it's just a continuation of that,"" he told reporters at the Austrian Grand Prix.
""I think it's also a more natural switch within the English teams without having to change your whole setup,"" he said.

The upstart Montreal Canadiens are down two games to none in the best-of-seven championship series following Wednesday's loss to defending champion Tampa Bay Lightning in Tampa.
The Canadiens, who have defied the odds by reaching the finals after being underdogs in each playoff round so far, are on a quest to end Canada's 28-year Stanley Cup drought. Montreal was the last Canada-based NHL team to lift the coveted Cup in 1993.
The series has brought out crowds in Canada's second-largest city, which has seen its tourism industry battered by travel restrictions and the cancellations of summer festivities like the Canadian Grand Prix Formula One motor race.
The Canadiens' unlikely advance to the Stanley Cup finals has fans driving around with team flags and created long lines to buy Montreal jerseys. It has also attracted tourists from other parts of the province, helping to fill restaurants, said Glenn Castanheira, executive director of business association Montreal Centreville.
""What we're living in downtown Montreal is something out of a fairy tale,"" he said. ""No one was expecting them to make the final.""
Foreign tourists visiting Montreal plummeted by about 85per cent in 2020 compared with 2019, according to Tourisme Montreal. Lockdowns have also deprived the city's downtown of 350,000 workers and 150,000 higher education students, Castanheira said.
The elimination of the heavily-favored Las Vegas Golden Knights on June 24 in Montreal, which advanced the Canadiens into the finals, saw packed revelers setting off fireworks, sparking celebrations in a city just coming out of confinement.
Some took the revelry too far with people throwing projectiles at officers, forcing Montreal Police to warn fans to avoid the area around the arena.
While Montreal's playoff run cannot compensate for the losses bars have incurred after being closed for most of the year, owners said it has generated much needed revenue and boosted morale.
""After all these months of being closed, reopening with the (Canadiens) in the playoffs - the stars are aligned,"" said Stuart Ashton, general manager and co-owner of McLean's Pub in the city's downtown.
Since restaurants are not allowed to fill to capacity due to health guidelines, some fans arrive in the afternoon to get a table ahead of playoff games that night, he said.
""There were so many people we had to say no to,"" Ashton said.
""The days of the matches are very animated. We are happy for the restaurants and bars,"" said Geneviève Jutras, a spokeswoman for Montreal Mayor Valerie Plante.
Alain Creton, owner of the downtown French brasserie Chez Alexandre, said the restaurant reserved its cigar lounge for a group of fans eager to watch Wednesday's second game in private at a cost of CUS$100 (US$80.65) each.
He is bringing in an additional large-screen television and three additional waiters to accommodate an expected maximum allowed capacity crowd on Friday.
""We will be very busy.""

The 23-year-old Dutch driver won the Styrian Grand Prix at Spielberg's Red Bull Ring from pole position last Sunday and will be chasing his third win in a row, and fifth of the season, this weekend.
Verstappen clocked a best time of one minute 05.143 seconds, with the Ferrari pair of Charles Leclerc, 0.266 slower, and Carlos Sainz second and third on the timesheets.
Mercedes' seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton, who is 18 points behind Verstappen after eight races, was only seventh fastest.
Teams were also testing a new Pirelli tyre with a stronger construction, after high-speed failures in Azerbaijan, that could be introduced at this month's British Grand Prix if approved.
Pirelli have also brought softer compounds for this weekend's race compared with last Sunday.
Hamilton's Finnish team mate Valtteri Bottas was fourth, ahead of AlphaTauri's Japanese rookie Yuki Tsunoda and Alfa Romeo's Kimi Raikkonen.
Verstappen's Mexican team mate Sergio Perez clocked the eighth-best lap.
Several names more familiar to Formula Two fans also appeared on the timing screens, with Chinese test driver Guanyu Zhou making his first Friday appearance in Fernando Alonso's Alpine.
Israeli Roy Nissany took George Russell's Williams for the session, and Britain's Callum Ilott took a turn in Antonio Giovinazzi's Alfa Romeo.
Formula Two leader Zhou was the quickest of the stand-ins, with the 14th-best time.

Schumacher senior, who won five of his seven titles with Ferrari, has not appeared in public since he suffered severe head injuries in a skiing accident in the French Alps in December 2013.
Mick, 22, has graduated to Formula One this season with Ferrari-powered Haas after winning last year's Formula Two title.
Four times world champion Vettel, nicknamed ""Baby Schumacher"" early in his career and also a former Ferrari driver, has been offering advice when asked.
""I am obviously friends with his father and his father is my hero,"" the Aston Martin driver told reporters ahead of Sunday's Austrian Grand Prix.
""We get along really well and I’m happy to help with stuff that maybe I can help with. In the driving sense it's always difficult, every car is different and every environment is different.""
An example was seen at the French Grand Prix in June when Schumacher was filmed showing Vettel the inside of his car's cockpit.
It turned out the youngster was pointing out his seat position, explaining later that he had been sitting crooked all season.
Schumacher said he valued Vettel's advice.
""He’s a huge help for me in all ways, anything on and off the track,"" he said.
""I’m happy that I can go back to somebody that has so much experience but also that is so likeable. Very happy he’s around.""
Haas team principal Guenther Steiner said he had no problem with a rival team's driver helping his own.
""I think it's a great thing,"" he told reporters on Friday. ""For Mick it's an advantage.
""Vettel is in the sport for a long time and he feels attached to Mick and just tries to help him as much as he can... I don't see any issue with it.""
Schumacher has been ahead of Russian rookie team mate Nikita Mazepin, whose father's company is the team's title sponsor, in qualifying and in most races this season. Haas have yet to score a point in eight rounds.
""I think he knows what to do behind the wheel,"" said Vettel of Schumacher. ""He's doing really well. I think it's not easy to come into your first year, it's a difficult situation for him.
""He seems to be lifting the while team... I think off track he's probably even more impressive, he's putting a lot of work in and he enjoys it.""

The new deal covers 2022 and 2023.
""I'm excited we're going to continue our partnership for two more years. We've accomplished so much together but we still have a lot to achieve, both on and off the track,"" said the Briton, 36, at the Austrian Grand Prix.
Hamilton, who joined Mercedes from McLaren in 2013 as replacement for retired seven-time champion Michael Schumacher, was out of contract at the end of this season after agreeing a one-year deal only in February.
""I have always said that as long as Lewis still possesses the fire for racing, he can continue as long as he wants,"" commented team boss and shareholder Toto Wolff.
Hamilton is the sport's most successful driver of all time, with 98 wins and 100 pole positions, and Mercedes had said they did not want to leave it so late again.
""I’m incredibly proud and grateful of how Mercedes has supported me in my drive to improve diversity and equality in our sport,"" said Hamilton, the sport's only Black driver, who has used his platform to campaign for social justice.
""They have held themselves accountable and made important strides in creating a more diverse team and inclusive environment.
""We’re entering a new era of car which will be challenging and exciting, and I can’t wait to see what else we can achieve together.""
Hamilton is fighting for a record eighth title but is second in the current championship, 18 points behind Red Bull's Max Verstappen after eight races.
Wolff said there was ""no better driver"" to have in the team as they prepare for major rule changes in 2022.
""His achievements in this sport speak for themselves, and with his experience, speed and race-craft, he is at the peak of his powers,"" added the Austrian.
""We are relishing the battle we have on our hands this year and that’s why we also wanted to agree this contract early, so we have no distractions from the competition on track.""
Liberty Media-owned Formula One welcomed the announcement that its star property had ended any speculation about his future.
""This is fantastic news for Formula One and I am delighted that Lewis will stay in F1 for at least another two years,"" said chief executive Stefano Domenicali.
""What he has achieved in this sport is incredible and I know he has more to come. He is a global superstar on and off the race track and his positive impact on Formula One is huge.""
Hamilton's team mate for 2022 remains to be decided, with Finland's Valtteri Bottas out of contract and young Briton George Russell tipped to replace him.

McLaren's Lando Norris joined Verstappen on the front row, a sensational career high for the young Briton, with Verstappen's Mexican team mate Sergio Perez qualifying third at the scenic Red Bull Ring.
The pole completed a hat-trick for the young Dutch driver, after France and last weekend's Styrian Grand Prix at the same Austrian circuit, with Red Bull now poised for a fifth successive win.
The 23-year-old is 18 points clear of seven-time world champion Hamilton after eight races, with Red Bull chasing a fifth successive victory to pull further ahead in both championships.
Verstappen's pole lap of one minute 03.720 seconds was only 0.048 faster than Norris's effort, Mercedes-powered McLaren's first front row since 2012.
""I think Q3 was pretty bad. I'm of course happy to be first but not the way we got it,"" said Verstappen of the tight margin, with Norris quicker all the way to turn nine but just missing out at the end.
""Of course to be twice on pole here nevertheless is very good. Hopefully we can finish it off tomorrow.""
The Dutchman was cheered on by the biggest crowd of a COVID-19 affected season, the majority in orange shirts - although Norris, whose car is papaya orange, jokingly questioned their allegiance.
""I feel epic,"" said Norris. ""It was probably one of my best laps I've done.
""The fans are cool here, everyone in orange supporting McLaren, not Max. It's cool to have them back. I know tomorrow's race is going to be tough but we did the best job we could today.""
EASY CRUISE FOR MAX
Hamilton, whose last pole was in Spain in May, recognised he faced even more of a challenge than last weekend, when he was on the front row but could not match Verstappen's speed.
""We tried everything to get more out of the car and it's just the underlying pace,"" said the Briton, whose two-year contract extension had been announced in the morning.
Hamilton said a win on Sunday looked out of the question on pure pace.
""I would say that's an easy cruise win for Max,"" he added. ""For us it's to see if we can get ahead of at least Perez and try to limit the damage this weekend.""
Hamilton's team mate Valtteri Bottas will line up fifth, with Pierre Gasly and Yuki Tsunoda sixth and seventh for AlphaTauri.
Sebastian Vettel qualified eighth for Aston Martin but was then handed a three place grid drop for blocking Alpine's Fernando Alonso, who ended up 14th.
That lifted George Russell to eighth instead for Williams.
Alonso was furious over the radio with Vettel, a four times world champion.
""I think we lost an opportunity to be tomorrow P5 or P6 on the grid, and a different race,"" he said. ""So now I guess we will not score points tomorrow. Whatever penalty they give to the others is never enough.
""It was probably our best car of the season in qualifying and we didn't maximise it.""
Russell did, securing his team's best qualifying effort since 2018.
""Q3 in any circumstances is massive for us, let alone doing it on the mediums,"" the 2018 Formula Two champion said of reaching the final phase. ""I've never been so pumped up since probably winning a race three years ago now"".
Less so was Australian Daniel Ricciardo, Norris's team mate, who qualified 13th and Alpine's Esteban Ocon in 17th.

Mercedes' seven-times world champion, the sport's most successful driver of all time, is 18 points adrift of the young Dutch driver after eight races.
Hamilton finished second to Verstappen at the same circuit in last weekend's Styrian Grand Prix, when he had qualified on the front row, and he said Sunday would be even more of a challenge.
""We continue to lack pace, we've tried everything to get more out of the car and it's just the underlying pace that is where we're at, at the moment,"" the Briton told Sky sports television.
Asked if a win was out of the question, Hamilton agreed it looked that way.
""I would say so. In terms of pure pace it's definitely out of the question.
""They've got three tenths on us, I think they've improved their car again this weekend. So I would say that's an easy cruise win for Max.
""I think for us it's to try and see if we can get ahead of at least Perez, try to limit the damage this weekend,"" he added.
Verstappen's Mexican team mate Sergio Perez qualified third, behind McLaren's Lando Norris.
Hamilton's day had started more positively with the announcement that the 36-year-old was staying at Mercedes for two more years, ending talk of any retirement at the end of the season.
""It's my family. I've been with Mercedes since I was 13 so it's pretty easy to continue,"" he said.

The Formula One stewards also handed out one penalty point for the incident, with double world champion Alonso having to abort his flying lap in the second phase of qualifying and ending up 14th on the starting grid.
Four times world champion Vettel qualified eighth and will still start ahead of Alonso.
His demotion lifts Williams' George Russell to eighth on the grid instead, with Aston Martin's Lance Stroll and Ferrari's Carlos Sainz also moving up a place.

McLaren's Norris was a career best second in qualifying behind Red Bull's Formula One leader Max Verstappen, with Mercedes' seven times world champion Hamilton fourth fastest.
""It's one of the first times to be the top Briton in qualifying, so it's a cool feeling,"" the 21-year-old told reporters.
With George Russell the only other Briton on the grid with struggling Williams, who have not scored a point for two years, Hamilton would normally expect to be his country's fastest qualifier.
Norris caught an aerodynamic 'tow' from Verstappen on track ahead of him in the final phase but made the McLaren, with a Mercedes engine, look impressively quick compared to Hamilton's car.
The youngster, who was faster than Verstappen up to the last corner, was not about to be carried away with the excitement, however.
""The Red Bull is still much quicker than us. It's just a fact. They're better,"" he said.
""Max pretty much did his time at the end in completely clean air. A decent amount of lap time comes from having a slipstream and putting yourself in the right position.""
On a headline day for English sport, with England playing Ukraine in the Euro 2020 soccer quarter-finals and teenager Emma Raducanu reaching the fourth round at Wimbledon on her Grand Slam debut, Norris was happy to also attract some attention.
He hoped there would be more on Sunday, however.
""If it is a headline, I'd prefer it to be in the race and not so much qualifying,"" he said.
Norris, who has raised his game to a new level this season, has finished seven of the eight races so far in the top five and scored points in the last 13.
Australian team mate Daniel Ricciardo, in contrast, qualified 13th as his season of struggle continued following a move from Renault, now Alpine.

Explaining the thinking behind a contract extension announced at the Austrian Grand Prix on Saturday (Jul 3), Mercedes' seven times world champion told reporters he was loving the challenge.
The 36-year-old said he had considered leaving but felt both he and the sport were entering an interesting new phase.
""I think we are being challenged more than ever this year, which is great,"" said the most successful driver of all time. ""And I love racing. This is what I want to do.""
Hamilton said his previous contract was supposed to be for two years but he asked for one because he was unsure whether he would continue or not, with the COVID-19 pandemic also casting uncertainty.
""I had the best and most enjoyable start of the year, enjoyed the rollercoaster ride that we're having,"" he explained.
""The start of this season, when the cars were so close in performance - pretty much equal - then it was really one of the most exciting times I've had for some time. To be able to have this battle with Red Bull.
""I was really hoping that it would continue on like that for the rest of the year but they've taken a huge leap forwards,"" said Hamilton.
The Briton is 18 points behind Max Verstappen after the opening eight races, with Red Bull winning four in a row up to Sunday after Hamilton triumphed in three of the first four.
Hamilton has used his platform to campaign for diversity and equal rights, an important part of his decision to stay, but he said he was also just loving his job.
""I found myself just waking up thinking about racing, so I wanted to continue to race,"" he said.
""Now we are having this tight battle it's brought me closer to the team, closer to the engineers, it's making me dig deeper and I love that. It has reinvigorated the love that I have for this sport and love for what I do.""
The new contract will see Hamilton, who has 98 wins and 100 poles, race on until he is 38 - an age he said ""doesn't actually sound that bad"".
He would not stick around just for the sake of it, though.
""There's going to be a point at which I'm going to want to move on to do different things ... I'm not going to do it at 80 per cent, 70 per cent and just trundle along,"" he said.
""I'm only here to win. So if there's ever a point that I feel I don't want to commit the time or the effort, that will be the time for me to stop. I don't plan to be here until I'm 40.

For the third time this season the 21-year-old finished third, after starting on the front row for the first time in his career, and was voted Driver of the Day by fans.
Mercedes-powered McLaren are also third in the constructors' championship, ahead of Ferrari, and Silverstone is next up with a crowd of some 140,000 expected on race day as COVID-19 restrictions are eased.
""The annoying thing is so many people are going to expect this every weekend now,"" Norris told Sky Sports television after the race at the Red Bull Ring.
""I'm not getting too giddy because I know we're going to go to Silverstone and it's probably going to be a little bit more like back to normality.""
Norris said McLaren had not expected to be so quick in Austria but a combination of factors, including warmer weather, had contributed along with improvements to the car. Australian Daniel Ricciardo started 13th and finished seventh.
Rivals noted the speed of the McLaren, with Norris ahead of both Mercedes cars in qualifying and passing seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton, who finished fourth in a damaged car, in the race.
""Such a great driver, Lando,"" commented Hamilton over the team radio.
Norris, who has finished in the top five in eight of nine races this year and is fourth overall, said he was not playing down his chances in order to then make himself look good.
""We've always been strong in Austria, every year since my first time coming here in F1. Silverstone was not so good for us last season,"" he said.
""It's not like I want to be negative. I'm just realistic and I feel like a lot of people are going to expect this every weekend from now on and complain 'why are we not quick?'.""
McLaren team boss Andreas Seidl said Norris could have finished second without a time penalty imposed after stewards ruled he had forced Red Bull's Sergio Perez off the track early in the race.

""We regret to announce that the 2021 Australian Grand Prix has been cancelled due to restrictions and logistical challenges relating to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,"" organisers said in a statement on the Nov 21 race.
The Australian round of the MotoGP world championship, scheduled for Phillip Island on Oct 24, was also cancelled for the second successive year.
""The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and resulting travel complications and logistical restrictions mean it has not been possible to confirm the viability of the event at this time, and it will therefore not feature on the 2021 calendar,"" organisers said.
Organisers hit roadblocks over Australia's requirement for overseas arrivals to undergo 14 days of mandatory quarantine.


The Formula 1 race had already been pushed back from its traditional season-opening slot in March to Nov 21, after the Brazilian Grand Prix and before the inaugural race in Saudi Arabia.
Cancellation means two years without a race at Melbourne's Albert Park after the 2020 edition was dramatically called off just before the opening practice session.
It follows the Singapore Grand Prix, scheduled for Oct 3, also being cancelled over COVID-19 worries.
The MotoGP circuit also skipped Australia last year due to the pandemic.


While Australia has been among the world's most successful countries in containing the coronavirus, Melbourne has struggled through several lockdowns.
Crowds are now back in sports stadiums in the city, but concerns remain high with Sydney currently in lockdown as it tackles an outbreak of the highly contagious Delta variant.
Victoria state premier Dan Andrews earlier suggested the cancellation was likely given low rates of local vaccination and a reduction in international flights to Australia.
""The timing doesn't quite line up, and that makes it very, very challenging,"" he said.
""We work very closely with all of our partners, particularly F1 and indeed the MotoGP as well. But some things are possible in a pandemic and some things are really hard.""

The sport wants to host three sprint races in 2021, with the first at Silverstone in July and the second scheduled for Monza in September.
The venue for the third has yet to be decided, with the United States in October and Brazil in November mentioned as the most likely candidates. Both have hosted title-deciding races in the past.
Under the new format, qualifying will switch to Friday with points awarded on Saturday to the top three drivers in a short 40 minute race to decide Sunday's starting grid.
Those extra points could, in theory, be enough to clinch the title although the current battle between Mercedes' seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen looks like going the distance.
The pair are so far separated by just four points after six rounds.
""We'd probably want to avoid the title being decided on a Saturday,"" Brawn told reporters in a briefing ahead of Sunday's French Grand Prix.
""If we went to the last race and a driver could win the championship on Saturday by winning a sprint event, that could bring an added dimension but I think we'll just try to avoid it while we find out how successful it is.
""We want to pick an event ideally a few races before the end of the season and we always want to pick tracks where we think the racing can take place in a short format with overtaking opportunities and a little bit of tyre degradation.
""I don't think we want to do it at the last race.""
Brawn said he understood purists might be unhappy with the proposed change but he urged them to hold judgement and give the format a chance.
He said the sprint race would give promoters and broadcasters more of a show with three meaningful days as well as potentially appeal to a new and younger audience of fans.
Brawn likened it to short-format cricket compared to Test matches, saying the former had attracted new fans for the traditional offering.
""We will never force this through if it's clearly not a success,"" he promised. ""There's no incentive in doing it if the audience don't engage.
""I think one of the great things about what's happening is that it's three races, it's not the season...If we don't get the response we hope, then we'll put our hands up and stay the way we are.""

Red Bull's world championship leader Max Verstappen and Aston Martin's Lance Stroll both suffered blowouts during the June 6 race in Baku, fortunately without injury. Verstappen's cost the Dutchman a race win.
Pirelli has indicated both teams were running the tyres on lower pressures than expected, while respecting the manufacturer's starting parameters and not doing anything illegal.
Lower tyre pressures bring more grip and increased performance.
A technical directive (TD) has been issued ahead of this weekend's French Grand Prix with the minimum tyre pressures boosted.
""It was a very interesting sequence of events this week with the TD coming out and seeing the carefully chosen words in the press releases and in the statements from all parties involved,"" said McLaren team boss Andreas Seidl.
""What is a bit disappointing for us is that there is not more transparency in what actually happened because it was a safety-critical topic, what happened there in Baku, and normally in cases like that there is transparency.""
Seidl said the regulations had been clear before Baku and there was a reason why Pirelli issued teams with minimum tyre pressures.
Asked what specifically he needed to know, Seidl said a lot of assumptions had been made about what actually happened.
""There's a lot of criticism up in the air also towards Pirelli but in the end that's not something we would support from our side because I think Pirelli has produced a safe product for this year,"" he added.
""In Baku, if you were running the car within the regulations and following the prescriptions from Pirelli there was no issue with the tyres.""

Norris told reporters at the French Grand Prix at Le Castellet that some of the players had messaged to say they were trying to beat his benchmark lap of Brands Hatch.
""I know some of them have been on the simulator trying to beat one of my lap times that I did at Brands. I don't think any of them have yet. I know Mason said he was trying hard to beat me,"" he said.
Norris said the Chelsea midfielder had sent him an England shirt and he would be wearing it when able to watch.
England play Scotland at Wembley in a Group D match later on Friday.
""There's a few of the guys who definitely want to come to a race. I said it would be awesome if they could come to Silverstone but obviously they can't as the football is on and they're quite busy during next month,"" said Norris.
""It’s a shame but hopefully in the future I can get a few of them round.""
Norris, a keen player as a kid and a casual Bristol City fan, said he followed England when major tournaments were on but otherwise did not watch much.
With a Belgian mother and a German team boss, Norris was looking forward also to some friendly rivalry.
""If my mom asks me who I'm supporting then I'll say Belgium. So I'm split. I would love both of them to do well,"" he grinned.
""I really, really hope we get to go against Germany and smash them just so I can laugh at (principal) Andreas (Seidl). That will make my year if that happens.""

After two tough street races for the reigning champions, Mercedes are hoping for a return to winning ways at a southern circuit they have dominated since its return to the calendar in 2018.
Seven-times world champion Hamilton won from pole position in 2018 and 2019 and Mercedes have also led every practice session.
Bottas topped the timesheets in one minute 33.448 seconds, with Hamilton 0.335 slower and Red Bull's championship leader Max Verstappen third with a lap of 1:33.880 and Azerbaijan GP-winning team mate Sergio Perez fourth.
Verstappen is four points clear of Hamilton after six rounds.
Alpine's Esteban Ocon was fifth and McLaren's Daniel Ricciardo sixth with Alpine's double world champion Fernando Alonso seventh.
Neither Ferrari made the top 10, with Charles Leclerc 11th and Carlos Sainz 16th.
Several drivers, including Bottas, damaged their cars and tyres on the kerbs and brightly painted abrasive run-off areas.
Aston Martin's Sebastian Vettel hit the barriers backwards and nursed his damaged car back to the pits, a set of tyres wrecked.
""Those yellow rumble strips on the exit of turn two have done an awful lot of damage to our car. They are just too aggressive,"" complained Mercedes sporting director Ron Meadows over the radio to race director Michael Masi.

Mercedes could be looking to replace Valtteri Bottas at the end of the season, while seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton is also out of contract then although he is expected to stay.
""He is a Mercedes-managed driver, that's about it,"" Rossi told reporters at the French Grand Prix at Le Castellet. ""He stays with us for the next three years.""
Rossi said Ocon reminded him of four times world champion Alain Prost.

757,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/verstappen-delivers-unexpected-french-gp-pole-1956841,Verstappen delivers the unexpected with French GP pole,"REUTERS: Formula One championship leader Max Verstappen pulled off the unexpected on Saturday when he snatched a comfortable French Grand Prix pole for Red Bull at a track that had until now been a happy hunting ground for rivals Mercedes.
The Dutchman, who leads Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton by four points in the overall standings, was in a league of his own around the 5.8-kilometre Paul Ricard circuit.
His lap of one minute 29.990 seconds made him the only driver to breach the 1:30 barrier and was good enough to beat seven-times world champion Hamilton by 0.258 seconds.
Verstappen's qualifying display followed an even more dominant showing in final practice earlier on Saturday when he lapped 0.747 seconds quicker than Hamilton’s team mate Valtteri Bottas, who qualified third for Sunday's race.
“I knew it was going to be better than the last time we were here but this good I didn't expect,” said Verstappen after taking his second pole position of the season and the fifth of his career.
“This has traditionally not been an amazing track for us but to be able to put it on pole here, of course we're super happy about that.”
Mercedes have been dominant at the track at Le Castellet in southern France since it joined the calendar as host of the returning French Grand Prix in 2018.
The team topped every practice and qualifying session for the 2018 and 2019 races, with Hamilton going on to win both from pole. The race did not take place last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The reigning champions had hoped the venue would set the stage for a return to form after disappointing outings at the last two races in Monaco and Baku.
“It's been a difficult weekend because we are just lacking pace,” Mercedes boss Toto Wolff told Sky F1.
“It looked much worse than in the end where we ended up but we just need to gain everywhere.”
For Red Bull, it proved that their speed around the street layouts in Monaco and Baku had carried over to the more conventional layout of Paul Ricard, after having been beaten by Mercedes at similar venues in Portugal and Spain.
Verstappen is hopeful he can get the job done and deal Mercedes their first defeat at the circuit on Sunday.
“I’m so confident that we can have a good race car anyway, so it’s going to be a long race. It will be a tight battle but I’m looking forward to it.”

Hamilton and Bottas had swapped chassis for this weekend's race at the Paul Ricard circuit as part of a planned rotation, Mercedes said in the build-up.
As a result, the Briton has been driving the chassis used by Bottas in the last four races, including a nightmare last round in Baku, while the Finn has the chassis that has carried Hamilton to three wins from six races.
Mercedes said both chassis were identical, but the swap, coinciding with an upswing in form for Bottas and greater struggles for Hamilton, has led to speculation and conspiracy theories.
""I saw you coming up with some myth so I was happy to be able to prove you wrong,"" Hamilton told Sky Sports F1 commentator and former racer Paul di Resta in the post-qualifying interviews.
""The quality of our engineers' work, (our) cars are exactly the same.""
Hamilton qualified second on Saturday, behind Red Bull pole-sitter Max Verstappen but ahead of Bottas in third.
The fired-up Finn, who headed into the weekend with speculation surrounding his Mercedes future, had led Hamilton through all three practice sessions.
Hamilton admitted to struggling but said that had more to do with getting the car in the optimum operating window.
""As you can see today I managed to do a great job with the same car,"" he said after beating Bottas in qualifying. ""So it’s no different.
""We’re just in general struggling with getting everything from the tyres and getting the car in the right window.""
Bottas agreed, saying: ""I think it's more in the head.
""You think some chassis is better, some not, so I don’t think there’s much difference.""

All players arriving in Australia for the tournament earlier this year had to spend 14 days in quarantine before they were allowed out to play, and those requirements, designed to keep the new coronavirus out of the country, remain in place.
Tiley said tennis players had been playing at tournaments in other countries without such strict restrictions and demanding they undergo strict quarantine before next January's Australian Open would be ""a tough ask"".
""Whether or not the playing group accepts that remains to be seen,"" he told Melbourne's 3AW radio on Wednesday.
""At this point, in our initial conversations with them, that's not something they're going to be open to, simply because that's not what they're currently doing around the world.
""If the conditions are as they are today, we may not be able to get the players to accept them.""
The Australian Formula One Grand Prix and MotoGP round, both due to take place in the state of Victoria, were cancelled for the second successive year on Tuesday because of the logistical problems caused by the border controls.
Victoria's Sports Minister Martin Pakula said on Tuesday he was confident the country's vaccine roll-out, which has been one of the slowest in the developed world, would be accelerated to the extent that restrictions would not impact the Grand Slam.
""I'm very confident that the Australian Open will proceed,"" Pakula told reporters.
Tiley said the professional tours had agreed to hold off on agreeing their 2022 schedules until the end of September to allow Australian Open organisers to get an indication from government of what the entry requirements might be in January.

Reutemann had undergone surgery in New York for a hepatic tumor in 2017 and struggled to regain full health.
""Dad left in peace and dignity after fighting like a champion with a strong and noble heart that accompanied him to the end,"" his daughter Cora tweeted.
In a career marked by brilliance behind the wheel and stubborn single-mindedness but also a lack of consistency, Reutemann was considered the greatest Argentine driver after five-time world champion Juan Manuel Fangio whose heyday was in the 1950s.
The son of a cattle rancher from Santa Fe province, Reutemann finished runner-up in the Formula One championship to Brazilian Nelson Piquet in 1981 after coming third in 1975, 1978 and 1980.
""He was a big part of our sport for many years and was a fighter to the end. He will be greatly missed,"" Formula 1 said in a statement.
The Argentine broke into Formula One in 1972 and joined Bernie Ecclestone's Brabham team alongside then twice world champion Graham Hill. He made a sensational debut, putting his car in pole position for his home grand prix in Buenos Aires before finishing seventh.
MOURNING
He also raced for Ferrari, leading the Italian team's challenge in 1978 after being overshadowed by Niki Lauda in 1977, and then joined Lotus in 1979. That proved a poor decision, with Ferrari finishing first and second in that year's championship and Reutemann a distant sixth.
He then moved to Williams in 1980.
""We are saddened to learn of the passing of our former driver Carlos Reutemann, winner of three Grands Prix for Williams during his career. Our thoughts go out to his family and friends at this difficult time,"" Williams Racing tweeted.
In 1981, he famously ignored team instructions in Brazil, refusing to let Alan Jones pass for the win, but led the championship ahead of the finale in Las Vegas where he qualified on pole.
Reutemann then faded in the race, won by Jones, and Piquet became champion by a single point.
Nicknamed ""Lole"" in a mangled reference to his love for pigs - ""los lechones"" in Spanish - he left the sport abruptly after the Brazilian Grand Prix in 1982 having raced in 146 grands prix, with 12 wins and 46 podium finishes.
After trying his hand in the World Rally Championship in 1985, Reutemann turned to politics and was elected governor for Santa Fe province, serving 1991-1995 and 1999-2003.
In 2003, he was elected senator for Santa Fe and re-elected in 2009 and 2015. He declined to run for president in 2002, even though polls showed he would have been a leading candidate.
Known for his indifference to fame, he failed to show at his own book launch in 1998, after working for years with a ghost writer.

Osaka stunned the tennis world when she quit the claycourt major last month after being fined and threatened with expulsion for declining to face media after her first match.
While the 23-year-old maintains a good relationship with journalists, she hopes the tennis world can respect mental health issues - just like any other workplace.
""It's OK to not be OK, and it's OK to not talk about it,"" Osaka wrote in an essay https://time.com/6077128/naomi-osaka-essay-tokyo-olympics for Time Magazine.
""I communicated that I wanted to skip press conferences at Roland Garros to exercise self-care and preservation of my mental health. I stand by that. Athletes are humans.""
Athletes should be allowed to occasionally skip media scrutiny for their mental wellbeing, she said.
""In my case, I felt under a great amount of pressure to disclose my symptoms - frankly because the press and the tournament did not believe me. I do not wish that on anyone.""
Traditional news conferences, where rows of journalists pepper sometimes highly personal questions at athletes often minutes after intense highs or lows in competition, were out of date, Osaka said.
""I believe that we can make it better, more interesting and more enjoyable for each side. Less subject vs. object. More peer to peer,"" she said.
Osaka's French Open exit led to an outpouring of support from fellow tennis professionals and other athletes from Venus and Serena Williams to Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton and former Olympic sprint champion Usain Bolt.
She was particularly inspired by encouragement from American swimmer Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian.
""Michael Phelps told me that by speaking up I may have saved a life. If that's true, then it was all worth it,"" she said.
After skipping Wimbledon, four-times major champion Osaka is focused on a successful return at the Olympics on home soil.
""An Olympic Games itself is special, but to have the opportunity to play in front of the Japanese fans is a dream come true,"" Osaka said. ""I hope I can make them proud.""

751,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/euro-2020-football-rice-and-phillips-england-1981156,Football: Rice and Phillips echo Ball and Stiles in England midfield,"LONDON: England have had some outstanding midfield partnerships over the last 50 years, players who have ruled Europe with their clubs, but Kalvin Phillips and Declan Rice have emerged as the unlikely pairing now set to conquer the continent for their country.
David Platt, Paul Ince and Paul Gascoigne tasted the semi-finals of Euro 96 and/or the 1990 World Cup, while Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard were among the best in the world for several years but could never quite seem to produce their best when in tandem for England.
Colin Bell and Norman Hunter were also a world class duo but were part of the team that failed to make the 1974 World Cup, and they were followed by a succession of domestic greats who never got close to glory on the international stage.
Now, a player who this time last year was helping Leeds out of the championship and a 22-year-old who was rejected by Chelsea as a teenager have formed the midfield shield that helped England through five games at the tournament without conceding a goal before Mikkel Damsgaard's free kick for Denmark spoiled the record in the semi-final.
As tactics come full circle, it is probably the relentless energy and terrier-style snapping of the Nobby Stiles/Alan Ball combination from England's 1966 World Cup-winning team that Rice and Phillips come closest to in terms of how they operate within the team.
Both have the ability to drive forward and deliver penetrative passes, which they do for their clubs, but both have also shown the tactical discipline demanded by coach Gareth Southgate to generally hold, and dominate, the space in front of the back four.
They both have a ravenous appetite for work and chase, harry, spoil, intercept and anything else they can think of to put the opposition off their stride.
Phillips began the tournament with a man-of-the-match display in the win over Croatia, while Rice was equally effective in snuffing out the threat of Luka Modric, having admitted he was ""miles behind him"" when watching England's World cup semi-final defeat from afar in 2018.
Against Germany the destructive duo faced the superstar pairing of Tony Kroos and Leon Goretzka - Leeds and West Ham v Real Madrid and Bayern Munich - and did an absolute job on them, starving them of time and possession and breaking up almost every developing attack.
“We faced players like Kroos, Goretzka or (Ilkay) Gundogan and people said that Kalvin and I could not compete against them. We had to fight each ball as if it were the last of our lives,” Rice said.
The return to full fitness of Southgate favourite Jordan Henderson led some to believe that the Liverpool captain would find his way back into the starting team, probably at the expense of Phillips, but the coach was not about to change a winning formula when on the brink of England's greatest moment for more than half a century.
""He's just a very good footballer,"" Southgate said of Phillips. ""High performance, low maintenance - we like that a lot.""
West Ham manager David Moyes has said pretty much exactly the same about Rice, who has grown in confidence since Moyes made him club captain at 21 and now swaggers around Wembley with his chest puffed out as if he owns the place.
His displays have been all the more impressive given that he suffered a knee ligament injury on Mar 31, putting his Euros participation in doubt.
Both players will need to drain the fitness tanks again to keep Italy at bay in the final but should they do so their names will sit deservedly alongside those of Ball, Stiles and rest of the boys of '66.",['751_0'],"[""\nFILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Euro 2020 - Semi Final - England v Denmark - Wembley Stadium, London, Britain - July 7, 2021 England's Declan Rice and Kalvin Phillips celebrate after the match Pool via REUTERS/Carl Recine/File Photo\n""]"

749,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/englands-black-players-face-racial-abuse-after-euro-2020-defeat-2024736,England's Black players face racial abuse after Euro 2020 defeat,"LONDON -Black players in the England soccer team have been subjected to a storm of online racist abuse after their defeat in the final of Euro 2020, drawing wide condemnation from the squad's captain, manager, royalty, religious leaders and politicians.
Marcus Rashford, 23, Jadon Sancho, 21, and Bukayo Saka, 19, were the targets of the abuse after they missed spot-kicks in a penalty shootout with Italy which settled Sunday's final after the game finished as a 1-1 draw.
The comments have prompted a police investigation and wide condemnation, although critics accused some ministers of hypocrisy for refusing to support a high-profile anti-racist stance the players had made during the tournament.
""Three lads who were brilliant all summer had the courage to step up & take a pen when the stakes were high,"" England captain Harry Kane wrote on Twitter.
""They deserve support & backing not the vile racist abuse they’ve had since last night. If you abuse anyone on social media you’re not an @England fan and we don’t want you.""
England manager Gareth Southgate called the abuse ""unforgivable"".
""I know a lot of that has come from abroad, that people who track those things have been able to explain that, but not all of it,"" he told a news conference.
Rashford himself wrote in a social media post late on Monday that he was thankful to his team mates for the support they extended to him and that he was overwhelmed by the messages of support towards him.
""I can take critique of my performance all day long... but I will never apologise for who I am and where I came from,"" Rashford said in his statement.
The England team have earned praise for their stand against racism, while a number of players have also campaigned on other social causes. The multi-racial make-up of the squad had been hailed as reflecting a more diverse modern Britain.
The team had highlighted the issue of racism by taking the knee before all their matches - a protest made by American football quarterback Colin Kaepernick and followed by the Black Lives Matter movement last year - saying it was a simple show of solidarity against racial discrimination.
However, some fans have booed the gesture, with critics viewing it as a politicization of sport and expression of sympathy with far-left politics.
Some ministers have been accused of hypocrisy for refusing to criticise those who booed and using it as part of a wider ""culture war"", often portrayed as a rift between those wanting to protect Britain's heritage from a ""woke"" youth, who see their elders as blocking moves to end racial and social injustice.
""This England team deserve to be lauded as heroes, not racially abused on social media,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson wrote on Twitter. ""Those responsible for this appalling abuse should be ashamed of themselves.""
While Johnson himself said the team should not be booed, his own spokesman had initially declined to criticise the fans over the issue when asked last month.
'STOKE THE FIRE'
Interior minister Priti Patel had also said she did not support players taking the knee because it was ""gesture politics"" and that it was a choice for the fans whether to boo players. On Monday, she joined those who denounced the abuse, but was criticised by England defender Tyrone Mings.
""You don’t get to stoke the fire at the beginning of the tournament by labelling our anti-racism message as ‘Gesture Politics’ & then pretend to be disgusted when the very thing we’re campaigning against, happens,"" he posted on Twitter.
The opposition Labour Party said Johnson and Patel were guilty of hypocrisy.
""The prime minister failed to call out the booing so whatever he says today rings hollow,"" said Labour leader Keir Starmer.
While the social media feeds of the players also showed huge levels of support, the abuse overshadowed the positive messages.
Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, said those who abused the players must be held accountable and Britain's Prince William, who is president of the Football Association, said he was sickened https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-prince-william-sickened-by-racist-abuse-england-players-2021-07-12.
""It is totally unacceptable that players have to endure this abhorrent behaviour,"" Queen Elizabeth's grandson said.
Seven times Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton voiced his support https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/f1-world-champion-hamilton-condemns-racist-abuse-england-players-2021-07-12 for the players.
The Football Association said fans who exhibited such ""disgusting behaviour"" were not welcome and European soccer governing body UEFA echoed its call for the strongest possible punishments.
London Police said officers were aware of the offensive and racist comments, and would take action. A mural of Rashford, who had campaigned for poor children to be given more support during the pandemic, was also covered in abuse.
A lawmaker in Prime Minister Johnson's Conservative Party also apologised after a private message in which she suggested Rashford should have spent more time perfecting his game than ""playing politics"" became public.
The issue of online abuse of players led to British soccer authorities briefly boycotting social media platforms before the tournament, while Britain is planning legislation to force tech firms to do more.
A Twitter Inc spokesperson said they had removed more than 1,000 tweets and permanently suspended a number of accounts, while Facebook Inc said it too had quickly removed abusive comments.

Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka missed their spot-kicks as Italy won 3-2 on penalties following a 1-1 draw after extra time at Wembley Stadium.
Hamilton, a vocal advocate for social justice, said on Instagram on Monday that the abuse suffered by the England trio showed how much still needed to be done in the fight against racism.
""The pressure to deliver is felt by every sportsperson but when you are a minority representing your country this is a layered experience,"" Hamilton said.
""Success would feel like a double victory, but a miss feels like a two-fold failure when it's compounded with racist abuse.
""We must work towards a society that doesn't require Black players to prove their value or place in society only through victory. Ultimately everyone on the England team should be so proud of their achievement and how they represented us.""
Twitter said it had removed more than 1,000 tweets and permanently suspended a number of accounts following the ""abhorrent"" abuse directed at the players, while Facebook said it had also removed abusive comments and accounts.
""The racial abuse on social media towards our players after yesterday's game is unacceptable,"" Hamilton added.
""This sort of ignorance has to be stopped. Tolerance and respect for players of colour should not be conditional. Our humanity should not be conditional.""",['748_0'],"[""\nMercedes' Lewis Hamilton before the race. (Photo: Pool via REUTERS/Christian Bruna)\n""]"

The team added in a statement the 21-year-old had his watch stolen.
""Thankfully, Lando was unharmed but he is understandably shaken,"" the team added.
""The team is supporting Lando and we are sure that racing fans will join us in wishing him all the best for the British Grand Prix this weekend.""
""As this is now a police matter we cannot comment further,"" it added.
British media reported the watch was worth 40,000 pounds (US$55,528.00) and was taken as he approached his McLaren sportscar.
Norris is friendly with several of the England players who lost the final on penalties after extra time ended 1-1.
The driver is fourth in the championship and has been on the podium three times so far this season.
Police made some 53 arrests at Wembley Stadium after supporters clashed with each other and officials, breached security cordons and charged into the perimeter area before the start of the match.

The report, led by the Royal Academy of Engineering, found that none of the seven British-based Formula One teams or 4,000 UK motorsport companies had ethnicity data for employees.
An estimate, however, suggested that only 1per cent of the 40,000 strong workforce was Black.
Rhys Morgan, director at the Royal Academy, told reporters the research also found examples of ""quite horrible racist comments"", which he said were waved away as 'banter'.
One Formula One engineer said he had experienced jokes about Black people, afro combs, fried chicken, crime rates and poverty in Africa while a Black female race marshal spoke of people addressing her in a Jamaican accent.
The commission found a number of barriers to diversity, including hiring from a select group of top universities, the rural locations of teams and systemic under-achievement in schools.
There was also a feeling among Black students that motorsport was not for them, while a cost cap introduced this season created a potential barrier for taking on more apprentices.
Recommendations include asking Formula One teams to implement a diversity and inclusion charter for motorsport and possible cost cap exemptions for taking on staff from Black backgrounds.
""A lot of the teams are responsive on this,"" said Morgan. ""We are keen to explore that further with the FIA and Formula One.""
The report, released in the week of the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, proposed the establishment of a fund to develop programmes to address the factors contributing to high school exclusion rates among students from Black backgrounds.
It also suggested the piloting of new approaches to increase the number of Black teachers in subjects leading to careers in engineering and the creation of scholarship programmes.
Hamilton, the sport's sole Black driver who was expelled from school as a youngster, hoped the report would start ""a ripple effect"" for change and saw it as a big part of his motorsport legacy.
""I would be like to be remembered for much more than just winning championships, which of course is an amazing thing on its own, but actually helping people and changing the industry and the viewpoints,"" he said.
""We all bleed the same. There's just no reason why it shouldn’t be as diverse as the world around us. If I am able to somehow shift the needle ... that's what I'm working towards.""
Formula One chief executive Stefano Domenicali hailed a ""comprehensive and impressive"" report.
""We will take the time to read and reflect on all of the findings, but we completely agree that we need to increase diversity across the sport,"" he said.

UEFA also said it had appointed an Ethics and Disciplinary Inspector to conduct a separate investigation into the ""events involving supporters which occurred inside and around the stadium"".
The final, which Italy won in a penalty shootout, was marred by clashes between fans and officials in and around the stadium.
British police, who said 19 of its officers were injured, have so far arrested a total of 86 people. Some 53 of the arrests were at Wembley.
The charges against the FA include: invasion of the field of play by its supporters, throwing of objects by its supporters, disturbance caused by its supporters during the national anthem and lighting of a firework.
Boos were heard around the stadium when the Italian anthem was played before kickoff while a pitch invader interrupted the match, with the referee stopping play while the stewards chased him down.
""The case will be dealt with by the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body in due course,"" UEFA said.
The Met Police had urged fans not to travel to Wembley if they did not have a ticket. However, several fans breached security cordons and charged into the perimeter area of Wembley before kickoff.
The FA said on Monday they would conduct a full review into the security breach. They condemned the behaviour of fans who forced their way into the stadium and apologised to those who had tickets for the ""unprecedented level of public disorder"".
British Formula One driver Lando Norris was mugged and had his watch worth 40,000 pounds (US$55,364) stolen, with his team McLaren saying the 21-year-old was ""understandably shaken"".
Last week the FA were fined 30,000 euros (US$35,460) after a laser pointer was shone at Denmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel during what proved to be the deciding moment of their Euro 2020 semi-final.
The FA were also charged for fans booing during the Danish anthem and for the setting off of fireworks during the semi-final.

The biggest sporting crowd in Britain since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with 140,000 expected on Sunday, will see Formula One history made with the debut on Saturday of The Sprint - a qualifying race without pitstops.
Slverstone, where the championship started in 1950, is the first of three tracks that will trial a 100km half-hour long dash to decide pole position and set the grid for the next day's main event.
""Even if... The Sprint is only the precursor to the main event, I think the drivers will be desperate to beat each other and show who's the fastest and who's the strongest,"" commented Formula One's managing director Ross Brawn.
A three-part qualifying session for The Sprint will be held on Friday instead of the usual second practice, meaning teams only have one hour on track to set up their cars before the competitive action.
A mistake on Friday is likely to carry far bigger consequences now, while fans - absent last year due to COVID-19 restrictions - can look forward to meaningful action on all three days.
Points will be on offer for the top three on Saturday, meaning a driver who wins both races and sets the fastest lap on Sunday can bank a maximum 29.
""I'm hoping of course to come out of that race with 29 points,"" said Red Bull's Verstappen, now 32 points clear of Hamilton after winning five of nine races including the last three.
""I hope in racing perspective it's coming home,"" he told Sky Sports television in a cheeky nod to the soccer chant sung by England fans before their team lost last Sunday's European Championship final to Italy.
Seven-times world champion Hamilton will be aiming for a record-extending eighth home win to regain some lost momentum, with his Mercedes team also bringing new parts to make the car faster.
He will also be racing at Silverstone for the first time since they named a straight after him.
Verstappen, winner of last year's 70th Anniversary race when the windswept former airfield hosted two successive rounds on a pandemic-hit calendar, can also secure a sixth win in a row for Honda-powered Red Bull.
""Mercedes have been enormously strong there over the years, and Lewis has his home support as well. So we expect it to be a big challenge,"" commented Red Bull team principal Christian Horner.
McLaren's Lando Norris will enjoy strong home support after notching up three podiums so far this season and narrowly missing out on a first pole in Austria.
""Seeing the grandstands full and everything feeling a bit more normal is something I’m really looking forward to,"" said the 21-year-old.
George Russell, at Williams, is the third British driver on the grid and will raise a big cheer if he can score the team's first points in two years.
Formula One fans will also get a glimpse of the future with the presentation online on Thursday of a life-size 2022 car, reflecting new rules designed to create closer racing.

The move comes after a commission set up by seven-times champion Lewis Hamilton to help boost the number of Black people in F1 published its report on Tuesday with 10 recommendations for change and some damning insights into the industry.
F1 launched the three new initiatives following a personal contribution of US$1 million from non-executive chairman Chase Carey.
""We want to be as diverse as our fan base and that is why we are taking direct action to ensure talented people from underrepresented groups have the best opportunities to get into, and build, a fantastic career in this amazing sport,"" said F1 chief executive Stefano Domenicali.
A total of 10 students from underrepresented groups - including ethnic minorities, women and those from under-privileged backgrounds - will be eligible for the engineering scholarships.
Each scholarship will cover the full cost of a student's tuition along with a living stipend. The scholars will be chosen from across six universities, with all 10 F1 teams committing to provide them work experience opportunities.
F1 will also have two-long term apprentices from underrepresented groups within the organisation this year, with a focus on mechanical engineering.
Six interns from underrepresented groups will also be offered roles across F1, including both short and longer-term placements.

The 100km Sprint will set the grid for Sunday's grand prix at Silverstone and, although some points will be awarded to the top three, there will be no formal podium to avoid detracting from the main event.
None of the drivers will be credited with a podium or race win but they will get a victory parade in front of the fans and be presented with specially-designed wreaths to wear around their necks.

""The moment recognises the seven decades of history in the sport and combines it with a modern twist - very similar to the Sprint itself.""
Formula One drivers of old were given large laurel wreaths to wear on the podium but they had the disadvantage of covering team and sponsor branding and the tradition was ended in the 1980s.

Frenchman Jean Todt, who has been FIA president since 2009, is standing down and an election for his replacement will be held in December.
British barrister Graham Stoker, Todt's deputy for sport, has already announced his candidacy and list of running mates, as has former rally driver Mohammed ben Sulayem of Dubai.
""I was asked to throw my hat into the ring and I'd consider it very carefully,"" Richards told Reuters after seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton opened Motorsport UK's new headquarters in Bicester.
""At the moment, as far we are concerned at Motorsport UK, we're waiting to see.
""I wait to see how both the current candidates are prepared to acknowledge the things that we think are important and how they are going to respond to those issues.""
Richards, who did not say who had asked him to stand, added there was no need for an immediate decision on the ""most appropriate"" candidate to support, or whether to join them.
""I wouldn't say I've ruled it out but I think if there's an appropriate candidate that we can support then we will,"" he added.
Asked whether that meant ""Watch this space"", Richards replied: ""I've been around motorsport all my life, and I know you never say 'never' on anything.""
Richards, 69, won the world rally championship as co-driver to Finland's Ari Vatanen in 1981 and was also Formula One team boss of Benetton and BAR.
His Prodrive engineering company ran Subaru's world championship winning rally team and also is currently involved in the all-electric off-road Extreme E series with a team owned by Hamilton.
During his visit, Hamilton was presented with the Hawthorn Memorial Trophy, awarded annually to the most successful British or Commonwealth driver competing in the Formula One World Championship.

The floor shape is also different and using ground effect for more downforce but the cars will be heavier than this year's models.
""The new cars will be elegant, streamlined and designed for racing to the limit,"" said Formula One chief executive Stefano Domenicali.
The cars raced by teams are sure still to differ individually.
The rule changes were meant to take effect this year but were delayed as part of cost-saving measures in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""There is huge excitement ahead of this new era, and while 2021 has been a great battle we still have cars struggling to follow each other during the race,"" said Formula One's motorsport managing director Ross Brawn.
""The regulations for 2022 will address this problem.
""We want the best drivers to win, we want much closer competition, we want them battling wheel to wheel.""

Red Bull have won the last five races in a row, with Verstappen chasing his fourth successive victory, but Hamilton was hopeful car upgrades would give him more of a chance of fighting back.

The new format, trialled for the first time at Silverstone this weekend, sees a qualifying session on Friday for the 100km sprint event on Saturday that will decide the grid for Sunday's grand prix.
Pole position has been secured until now by the driver who posts the fastest time in final qualifying but in this case Formula One and the governing FIA are reducing the focus on a single lap and effectively rewarding a race winner instead.
The decision has triggered debate about the sport's statistics, and whether it devalues past poles.
""Pole is the fastest lap time achieved, or the fastest lap time in qualifying,"" Vettel, a four times world champion who has a keen interest in the sport's history, told reporters.
""If this is a one-off then it doesn't do much harm. But if we end up having 10 sprint races next year or in the future, then I think it's just a bit weird.
""It's a new discipline, so they didn't have it 50 years ago and now we have it. So then we just add a new column to the statistics,"" added the Aston Martin driver who has 57 poles to his credit.
Vettel said having only a one hour free practice session before Friday qualifying at least meant less hanging around and more action on track.
Now-retired Rosberg, who achieved 30 poles and was world champion with Mercedes in 2016, agreed with his fellow German's stance in a post on Twitter.
""This is not the right decision. Pole 100per cent has to go to the fastest guy in qualifying. The sprint race winner should not be awarded pole position. That will totally cannibalise the historic F1 statistics,"" he said.

""He is definitely getting closer and his race pace is stronger than his qualifying pace at the moment. I think it shows how good Lando is,"" Brown told reporters at the British Grand Prix.
""(Lando) has shown he’s an awesome racing driver so I think Daniel’s up against tough competition.
""I think we are surprised, he’s surprised that he’s not nearer Lando’s pace - but the good news is everyone’s working very hard, everyone knows where we need to improve,"" added the American.
""Daniel knows where he needs to improve, so there’s no excuses, just hard work ahead of us and I hope he gets on top of it because we need two cars constantly in the front if we’re going to hold onto third in the championship.""
McLaren team principal Andreas Seidl said Ricciardo, winner of seven races with Red Bull, was responding well to the challenge.
""I was very happy with race Sunday in Austria where he pulled off a very strong race, good move forward and scored important points,"" he said.
""We continue to work hard together with the team over the last one and a half weeks to make the next step also on Saturday.
""I'm quite optimistic. It's not far away until we have Daniel back also on Saturdays, as we all know from the past, and then the integration process is history.""
Ricciardo qualified seventh for Saturday's sprint race at Silverstone, with Norris sixth. The pair were separated by just 0.002 of a second.

Mercedes' seven-times world champion Hamilton qualified for the new Saturday sprint, which will determine Sunday's grid, with the fastest time while McLaren's Norris was sixth and Russell eighth for Williams.
After nearly a year and a half of restrictions to limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a sense of relief and release.
If Hamilton started his day urging fans to keep wearing their face masks in what will be the country's biggest sporting crowd since 2019, his tone after qualifying was one of pride and gratitude.
Silverstone hosted two races last year, both behind closed doors, and the presence of large numbers of fans has been missed.
""So overwhelming,"" Hamilton said of his qualifying performance.
""It's been such a difficult time for everyone and we've finally got all the fans at the British Grand Prix and the desire to want to deliver for everyone is beyond belief.
""We watched the England game the other day and to see how much passion there is in England, and I know it was a difficult time for everyone but so much hope that I was hoping I could do my part...""
The last pre-pandemic race held at the circuit with spectators in 2019 saw a three-day attendance of 351,000 and 141,000 on Sunday. This year's race is sold out with similar numbers expected.
Silverstone has a large site and all those attending must either be fully vaccinated or test negative for the virus as part of the British government's pilot scheme.
Some races in the past year have had limited attendances but nothing on such a scale.
""Every lap I could see them jumping up and cheering,"" said Russell of the fans.
""We've not experienced that this year. We've had a year and a half without any fans at all and to come back to capacity on a Friday, it's a good feeling.
""For sure it give you lap time because you're more motivated, more excited. You've got that extra spring in your step. You feel a sense of responsibility to perform for them.""
Norris agreed: ""You see them standing up and cheering which is a cool feeling. It gets you pumped, it gets you motivated to try and nail your next lap or whatever.
""I think the bigger impact is going to be tomorrow, coming back into the track and seeing them all. It's just exciting.""

Formula One is trialling a new format at Silverstone, with a 17-lap race deciding the starting grid for Sunday's headline grand prix.
The grid for the sprint was decided on Friday, with Mercedes' seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton taking the top slot and Verstappen alongside on the front row.
Verstappen's lap of one minute 29.902 seconds, set early on a sunny afternoon with a big crowd in attendance, was 0.375 quicker than Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, whose Spanish team mate Carlos Sainz was third fastest.
Hamilton was eighth, with team mate Valtteri Bottas ninth, but the focus was on long runs with more fuel on board. McLaren's Lando Norris and Daniel Ricciardo were sixth and seventh respectively.
Verstappen is 32 points clear of Hamilton after nine races but that could change on Saturday, with three points awarded to the sprint winner, two for second and one for the third finisher.
Sunday's race is as normal, with 25 points for the winner plus one for the fastest lap.

The experimental format, with qualifying on Friday for a 17-lap sprint on Saturday to decide the grid for Sunday's race, is aimed at providing more thrills for fans with three days of competitive action.
It is being trialled at three races this year, with Silverstone the first, and could be rolled out to more next season depending on the reaction from fans.
""We’re already getting massive feedback, positive feedback, from the fans on social media,"" said the managing director for motorsport.
""They love it. But there will be fans who make some comments and what they didn’t understand or appreciate, we’ll take that into account as well.""
Brawn, a former Honda team boss who won championships with his own team in 2009 before it was sold to Mercedes, was a main architect of the change and said he was 'very pleased' with how it turned out.
""That first lap or so was completely nail-biting, and sensational, and then we had the little duels in the rest of the race,"" he said.
""Alonso’s performance today was sensational, got my vote for the highlight of the race. I’d buy a ticket for that any day, so we’re very pleased.""
Spaniard Alonso, a double world champion, made a great start in his Alpine to rocket from 11th on the grid to fifth within a few corners.
Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said the race, won by Red Bull's championship leader Max Verstappen, had been a bit dull towards the end but the format had merit and deserved its place in the sport.
""I'm not a fan of live experimenting but this one is not hugely controversial,"" he said. ""I'm totally against reverse grids, it's just fake, but here everybody started from the right positions.
""Fundamentally I think if we do five races like this, I'm pro,"" added the Austrian.",['730_0'],"['\nFormula One - F1 - Chinese Grand Prix - Shanghai, China - 6/4/17 - Formula One Managing Director of Motorsports Ross Brawn walks at the Shanghai International Circuit ahead of the Chinese F1 Grand Prix.

Mercedes' seven-times world champion, who has won his home race a record seven times already, warned, however, that it would be tough.
""I need everyone to bring their energy again tomorrow and I’ll come with my A-game,"" the Briton told the 105,000-strong crowd at Silverstone.
A capacity attendance of more than 140,000 is expected on Sunday in the biggest sporting event in Britain since the COVID-19 pandemic led to closed doors last year.
Most will still be hoping to see Hamilton, the most successful Formula One driver of all time, celebrate a 99th career victory.
Hamilton had qualified at the front of the grid for the experimental sprint race but lost out at the start as Red Bull's Verstappen, alongside on the front row, made the quicker getaway.
""I think he had a lot of pace in him today and I don’t think he was particularly having to push too hard, and we were flat-out,"" said Hamilton of the difference between his car and Verstappen's.
""Tomorrow’s going to be tough. If I can try somehow to keep up with them through the stints, maybe we can apply pressure through strategy - but we’re not going to be overtaking them on the track: they’re just too fast.""
Verstappen will start with a 33-point advantage over his closest rival and every chance of chalking up a sixth win in 10 races.
Saturday's sprint was a 17-lap affair without pitstops while the grand prix will allow more opportunities through strategy.
Hamilton recognised he needed to make a better start, however.
He said he had done everything correctly but for whatever reason the clutch did not deliver and he suffered a lot of wheelspin.
""Their starts are really great this year and we have lost a bit of performance on our starts, so we’ve got to try to work a bit harder to try to improve that because losing positions is never a great thing,"" he said.

Seven-times world champion Hamilton will start alongside his Dutch rival in Sunday's grand prix after finishing second for Mercedes in a 17-lap qualifying race that lasted just over half an hour.
The winner took three points, with two for the runner-up and one for third place.
Hamilton's team mate Valtteri Bottas finished third, ahead of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, in a race aimed at providing more thrills for fans over the three days of track action and potentially shaking up the starting grid.
""We had a good start and a good fight with Lewis on the first lap and then we tried to do our own pace. You could see we were pushing each other hard, because at the end of the race the tyres were blistering a lot,"" said Verstappen.
""In the end I'm happy of course to have got those three points - it sounds a bit funny to then hear you scored a pole position. But anyway we'll take it. It should be a really exciting battle tomorrow.""
The top three were taken by truck for a parade lap around the circuit instead of the usual post-race podium celebrations, with no champagne spraying but the winner was garlanded with an old-style laurel wreath.
The pole was a fourth in a row for Verstappen, who will be chasing his sixth win of the season and fourth in succession on Sunday.
It also ended a Mercedes run of nine poles in a row at Silverstone.
GAME OVER
Hamilton had qualified at the front of the grid on Friday, with Verstappen alongside, but lost out at the start and despite a brief wheel to wheel battle it was effectively game over by the end of the lap.
The Red Bull, despite flames flickering from the front left brakes, proved too quick for the Mercedes to catch with a 1.430 second gap to Hamilton at the finish.
""Tomorrow we fight again, but they're just so strong. In the race he was pulling away,"" Hamilton told 2009 world champion and former McLaren team mate Jenson Button, conducting the interviews.
""There was nothing I could do to hold onto him so we've really got to try and be in front somehow,"" added the Briton, who has won his home race a record seven times, as he waved to tens of thousands of cheering fans on a hot afternoon.
The big casualty of the new format was Verstappen's team mate Sergio Perez, who spun off across the gravel on lap six while in seventh place.
He managed to avoid the barriers and continued before being told by the team to retire.
""We thought there wasn't much to gain (in continuing) so we preferred to retire the car,"" said the Mexican, whose team risk seeing their 44-point lead over Mercedes shrink in the constructors' standings.
The big gainer at the start was Alpine's Fernando Alonso, with the twice world champion rocketing from 11th to fifth before eventually finishing seventh.
McLaren's Lando Norris and Daniel Ricciardo were fifth and sixth respectively and Sebastian Vettel eighth for Silverstone-based Aston Martin.
Britain's George Russell finished ninth for Williams but was later handed a three-place grid drop for causing a collision with Ferrari's Carlos Sainz, who finished 11th.
The penalty moved Alpine's Esteban Ocon up to ninth with Sainz 10th.

The Mercedes driver, now only eight points behind Verstappen after 10 races, passed Ferrari's Charles Leclerc with two laps to go as a capacity 140,000 crowd rose to cheer him on.
Hamilton's team mate Valtteri Bottas finished third after being told to let Hamilton through to chase Leclerc, who had led from the re-start and was voted driver of the day.
The win was the 99th of seven-times world champion Hamilton's Formula One career, fourth of the current campaign and one of the more controversial in his long list of achievements.
It was also the worst possible result for Verstappen, who had started on pole position with a 33-point lead but failed to complete a lap after suffering the biggest accident of his career when he crashed out at Copse corner.
Hamilton went down the inside, Verstappen moved across and they tangled wheels - the Red Bull's rear right touching the front left of the Mercedes.
The stewards deemed Hamilton was to blame.
Red Bull said Verstappen was battered and bruised and in hospital for further checks. Team boss Christian Horner criticised Hamilton for a mistake he deemed amateur, dangerous and desperate.
Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said, however, that the situation was more nuanced and ""it takes two to tango"".
A day that was almost a return to pre-pandemic normality, with crowds cheering in the sunshine from packed grandstands, ended with a British winner, a thrilling late chase for victory - and plenty to argue about.
It also lit a fire under the title battle, after previous pleasantries between the two rivals, with the gloves now decidedly off and Red Bull's momentum abruptly halted after five wins in a row.
From being 44 points clear in the constructors' championship, Red Bull are now only four ahead of Mercedes.
The front-running pair are now at daggers drawn with Red Bull accusing Hamilton of dangerous driving and the Briton highlighting Verstappen's aggressive approach.
HOME HERO
None of that was stopping the home hero from celebrating with his army of fans, however.
""This is a dream for me today, to do it in front of you all,"" Hamilton told the biggest crowd to attend a sporting event in Britain since COVID-19 made its presence felt. Last year's race was held without spectators.
""I always try to be measured in how I approach, particularly with battling with Max, he's very aggressive. And then today I was fully alongside him and he didn't leave space.
""Regardless of whether I agree with the penalty, I take it on the chin and I just kept working.
""I was like 'I'm not going to let anything get in the way of the crowd's enjoyment of the weekend and the national anthem and the British flag'.""
Leclerc also kept his head up after missing out on what would have been Ferrari's first win since 2019.
""I gave not 100 per cent but I gave 200 per cent. I gave all of me but it was just not enough in the last two laps,"" said the Monegasque.
""Congratulations to Lewis, he did an incredible job.""
There was no point awarded for fastest lap, with Red Bull's Mexican Sergio Perez setting it and then retiring with no prospect of the top 10 finish that would have triggered the bonus.
The main aim at that point, however, was to keep it out of Hamilton's hands.
McLaren's Lando Norris gave the fans more to cheer about with fourth place, a result that lifted him to third in the standings, ahead of Australian team mate Daniel Ricciardo.
Ferrari's Carlos Sainz was sixth, his hopes hit by a stuck wheel in a slow pitstop but the points helping Ferrari narrow the gap to McLaren.
Behind them, double world champion Fernando Alonso was seventh for Renault-owned Alpine with Canadian Lance Stroll eighth for Aston Martin.

Horner said Mercedes' seven-times world champion, the most successful driver in the history of Formula One, made an amateur error in trying to pass at Copse corner on the opening lap and dismissed the Briton's 99th career victory as 'hollow'.
He said Hamilton, who did not feel he was to blame for what others also called a racing incident, had put a fellow competitor's safety ""in jeopardy"".
""We're just lucky today, unfortunately after a 51-G accident, that there wasn't somebody seriously hurt. What I'm most angry about is the lack of judgement, or the misjudgement and desperation,"" he added.
""Thankfully we got away with it today but had that been an awful lot worse, a 10-second penalty would have looked pretty meaningless.""
The controversial clash slashed Verstappen's championship lead from 33 points before the race to a mere eight after 10 rounds.
Hamilton was handed the time penalty for causing the collision but raced back to take the lead from Ferrari's Charles Leclerc with two laps to spare. It was his record eighth home win.
Horner said Verstappen was battered and bruised and in hospital after the biggest accident of his Formula One career.
The crash brought the race to a temporary halt as barriers were repaired.
""I can't see how Lewis can take any satisfaction out of a win when you've put your fellow competitor and driver in hospital,"" said Horner.
Verstappen also chimed in on Twitter.
""Glad I'm OK. Very disappointed with being taken out like this. The penalty given does not help us and doesn’t do justice to the dangerous move Lewis made on track,"" said the Dutch youngster.
""Watching the celebrations while still in hospital is disrespectful and unsportsmanlike behaviour but we move on.""
Hamilton had set the fastest lap in Friday qualifying for Saturday's first ever sprint race that then determined pole position for Sunday's race.
Verstappen seized the lead at the start of that sprint and was never threatened.
Horner suggested Hamilton's behaviour had been influenced by the sprint because he knew Verstappen would likely disappear into the distance again unless he did something.
""I think he was wound up after yesterday's result,"" he added. ""He was obviously fully motivated, and he just made a massive misjudgement.""
Horner also criticised Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff for going to see stewards while the race was halted, saying it was unacceptable to try and lobby them.
""I don't think the stewards should be interfered with,"" he declared.
The Briton said he also went to see them in response to Wolff's move to ensure his team's views were heard.

The first lap clash sent Red Bull's Verstappen crashing out, and on to hospital for checks, while Hamilton fought back from a 10 second penalty to win for Mercedes and slash the gap at the top to eight points.
The afternoon ended in argument and accusation, with Hamilton also subjected to racial abuse on social media channels.
""As is always the case in these matters, there will be a wide range of opinions on the rights and wrongs,"" said Brawn in a column for the official Formula One website on Monday.
""What is clear is that we were robbed of a thrilling battle and nobody wants the championship decided on crashes and penalties.
""I hope we can avoid those incidents in the future because I think we were denied a fantastic battle today.""
For some, what happened was an accident waiting to happen and also a game-changer that has lit a fuse under a title tussle between the sport's most successful driver and his heir apparent.
McLaren boss Zak Brown said already in May that he felt it was ""a matter of time"" before both tangled into the first corner and neither came out.
Andrew Shovlin, Mercedes' head of trackside engineering, expressed a similar opinion on Sunday.
It took until turn nine at Silverstone, and it was only Verstappen that did not continue, but the point was made.
Hamilton, the seven-times world champion and now winner of his home race a record-extending eight times, showed that when push comes to shove he is not prepared to back down.
""I think this year he (Verstappen) has been very aggressive and most of the times I’ve had to concede and just avoid incident with him and live to fight on later in the race,"" said the 36-year-old Briton.
""Once he's out in the clear, they're too fast so when an opportunity comes, I've got to try and take it. That's what we're out there doing.""
What happened on Sunday followed a pattern in close title battles - reminiscent of the elbows-out duels of old between Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost or more recently Hamilton v Nico Rosberg.
Hamilton and Verstappen had been complimentary enough about each other early in the campaign but the tone is different after 10 races.
Hamilton and Mercedes highlighted Verstappen's 'aggressive' driving while Red Bull accused the Briton of a dangerous and desperate move.
The bigger picture is that the heat has been turned up, the battle lines are drawn and things are likely to get a lot more lively.
Hamilton hoped they could still find ""the best balance"" and give each other ""space and respect... so that we can continue racing and have good races without colliding"", but that may be wishful thinking.
History shows that the more there is at stake, the more tempers are likely to rise and rivalries boil over.
Hamilton wants that record eighth title, one more than Michael Schumacher, and Dutch 23-year-old Verstappen wants to be his country's first champion.
Neither are about to blink or flinch, two of the most mentally tough and determined drivers in a battle all of their own.

Allison said in a post-race debrief that the seven-times world champion had done nothing wrong.
""As far as we were concerned...the manoeuvre that Lewis did was absolutely in line with the FIA's overtaking guide,"" he said.
""If you are...overtaking on the inside of the corner, then the guidance requires that you are substantially alongside, it is not required that you are ahead...Lewis definitely was substantially alongside.
""So I did feel that it was harsh to get the penalty...this is about what are the rules to do with overtaking and I didn't see that Lewis did anything wrong with respect to those rules.""
Allison pointed out that Hamilton, who won the race despite being handed a 10-second time penalty, had carried out two subsequent overtakes at the same place without making any contact.
Verstappen crashed out at speed after the two cars made contact at Copse corner and was taken to hospital for checks.
The lack of points from the grand prix meant the Dutch driver's overall lead was slashed from 33 points to eight after 10 rounds. Verstappen had won three points from a new Saturday sprint.
Red Bull team boss Christian Horner said Hamilton had made ""a massive misjudgement"" out of desperation.

THE ABSOLUTE BASICS
* Road cycling is split into two events for each gender - a road race and a time trial.
* The men's race in Tokyo will see 130 participants, with a maximum team size of five, battling over a rugged 234km course which takes in the iconic Mount Fuji. Meanwhile, 67 women will race over 137km with an elevation gain over 2,692m.
* Both individual time trials are solo races against the clock. The men will race 44km with the women doing 22.1.
HOW MANY MEDALS?
Four gold medals are up for grabs - one each for men and women in road cycling and individual time trial events respectively.
WHAT HAPPENED IN RIO?
Dutch rider Annamiek van Vleuten suffered a horror crash while leading the women's race, allowing team mate Anna van der Breggen to claim gold in a thrilling finish.
Belgian Greg Van Avermaet outsprinted a small group to win the men's race after pre-race favourite Vincenzo Nibali broke his collarbones in another high-speed crash.
In the women's time trial, American Kristin Armstrong became the first cyclist to take gold in the same road event at three different Olympic Games.
Now-retired Fabian Cancellara won the men's TT.
WHAT CAN WE EXPECT FROM TOKYO?
Reigning world champion Julian Alaphilippe has decided to skip the Games so Slovenia's Tadej Pogacar, fresh from winning his second successive Tour de France, will be the man to beat although the race is expected to be unpredictable.
In the women's races, it will be hard to look beyond the Dutch all-star line-up of Marianne Vos, Van der Breggen and Van Vleuten. Their biggest challenge in the time trial should come from American Chloe Dygert, who aims to compete in both track and road events.
WHAT'S NEW?
The races will end at the picturesque Fuji International Speedway, which hosted a number of Formula One races in the past.
WHEN IS IT HAPPENING?
Road races: July 24-25.
Individual time trial events: July 28.
WHERE IS IT HAPPENING?
Both the men's and women's road races will start in eastern Tokyo at Musashinonomori Park before finishing at the Fuji International Speedway motor racing circuit located at the foot of Mount Fuji.
The time trials will heavily feature the racing circuit, while also take the riders through countryside nearby.
HOW DID WE GET HERE?
According to a popular legend, the first ever bike race was held over a 1,200m course in Paris in 1868. The sport went on to make its Olympic debut in 1896 and road events have been ever-present on the programme since the Stockholm 1912 Games.

719,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/motor-racing-right-time-right-place-high-flying-bird-2038341,"Motor racing-Right time, right place for high-flying Bird","LONDON: Sam Bird is on top of the world as he heads into two home Formula E races in London this weekend, and he intends to stay there.
The 34-year-old Jaguar driver is leading the all-electric series with four races to go, making him the only Briton currently on top of any of the governing FIA's world championships.
""Normally there’s quite a handy chap in Formula One that’s doing the job, but he’s not far behind is he?,"" the Londoner told Reuters.
Formula E is a very different world to that of Mercedes' seven times Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton, currently eight points behind Red Bull's Max Verstappen, but there are some overlaps.
Bird was a Mercedes reserve before making the switch to electric and a number of ex-F1 drivers are leading lights in the series.
A Formula E veteran, Bird is the only driver to have won a round in every season since the first in 2014.
He is in a tight battle, five points clear of Portugal's Antonio Felix Da Costa but with only 13 points separating the top six.
The Briton finished third overall in 2017-18, after winning the opening round, and in 2018-19 he led after winning round three in Chile. He also won the opener in 2019-20.
He was top after three rounds this year but was 13th before a pair of races in New York catapulted him back to the lead, making him only the second multiple winner of the season.
Now he hopes to pull away on a big weekend for his British team and brand.
""I must be doing something right, but I must be doing something right at the wrong time,"" he said of past spells in the lead.
""I’d quite like to get it right at the right time this year. Is now the right time? Let’s see.""
Having two races at home will be a boost, although the track that winds around and through the ExCel centre in the Docklands area of East London is new to all.
London's Battersea Park was used in 2015, when Bird was a winner, and 2016.
""It’s such an open championship,"" he said of a series where every driver in the top 10 has either had multiple retirements or repeatedly failed to score.
""I think this year, there’s one of two ways of really winning it. Either somebody is going to go out there and win a couple of races and get an unassailable lead or it’s going to be somebody that consistently scores a reasonable amount of points.
""Nothing too crazy, but somebody that’s just plodding along might end up winning it.""

In a combative column on the Red Bull website, Horner revealed the championship leader's seat was broken by the first lap impact in last Sunday's race at Silverstone.
He continued to blame Hamilton and said Mercedes' race winner and seven-times world champion had got off lightly with a 10-second penalty.
""Given the severity of the incident and the lenient penalty, we are reviewing all data and have the right to request a review,"" said Horner.
""We are therefore still looking at the evidence and considering all of our sporting options.""
Verstappen had started the race 33 points clear of Hamilton, after winning a Saturday sprint, but ended up only eight ahead after crashing out when they made contact at Copse Corner.
Hamilton had tried to pass on the inside and Verstappen moved across, with the cars colliding.
Horner complained to race director Michael Masi at the time about Hamilton's driving and Mercedes boss Toto Wolff went to see the stewards before they had taken a decision, followed by the Red Bull principal.
Masi had cleared Wolff to do so but teams have now been warned they face punishment in future if any personnel visited the stewards uninvited.
Horner said he had gone to make the point that it was not appropriate for anyone to interfere and was pleased to see the FIA clarification.
He defended Verstappen from accusations by Mercedes and Hamilton of being an 'overly aggressive' driver.
""You only have to look at the fact Max has zero penalty points on his licence and has not been found guilty of any on-track misjudgements in recent years,"" he said.
""The aggressive 17-year-old F1 rookie Max Verstappen that Hamilton is referring to is not the Max Verstappen of today, just as Hamilton is not the same driver he was when he entered the sport.
""The reality is that Hamilton has met his match in a car that is now competitive, and I agree that both drivers need to show each other respect, but Hamilton was the aggressor on Sunday.""
Horner said also that he was disappointed by the 'level of celebrations' after the race by Hamilton and Mercedes, with Verstappen still in hospital for checks.

The 28-year-old mountain man, known in the men's professional peloton as La Locomotora by dint of his relentless engine, shrugged off everything the elite field could throw at home before launching a solo bid for glory.
Better known as a climbing specialist with his Ineos Grenadiers team, Carapaz powered home like a Formula One car on the Fuji International Speedway to leave his rivals trailing a minute behind him in his tracks.
It was a phenomenal effort at the end of a six-hour 234-km ride from Tokyo's outer suburbs into the majestic climbs around Mount Fuji - culminating in the eye-watering Mikuni Pass where the 20per cent gradients saw rider after rider shelled out the back.
Slovenian phenomenon Tadej Pogacar, who won his second consecutive Tour de France this year, thought he could crack Carapaz on that hellish stretch of tarmac. But he had not counted on the South American's iron core.
Carapaz led a successful chase down of Pogacar and then on the next climb, a short burst up the Kagosaka Pass 21km from the end, he and American Brandon McNulty launched their attack.
They accelerated away to gain two minutes on a lightning fast descent but whereas McNulty faltered 5km from the finish line as Belgian Wout Van Aert led a chasing pack to within 14 seconds of the leading duo, Carapaz rode off into the distance.
It was a masterful performance and will go down in Ecuador's sporting folklore as he delivered only the country's second Olympic gold medal after Jefferson Perez's victory in the race walking event at Atlanta in 1996.
Carapaz had already won a Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's crown jewels, and was third in the Tour de France which ended last weekend, but he said an Olympic gold was ""incredible"".
""To see your flag as the top one, and to have this medal with me. It's sensational,"" Carapaz, who spent the early months of this year riding the gravel roads on the side of the Cotopaxi Volcano in the Andes, told reporters.
""It gives me a lot of satisfaction. I have worked very hard, and then it works out in a way that makes history for me and for my country. To be able to be a part of the history of my country is very important.""
It was a stunning performance and there were few complaints from the riders he left in his wake including silver medallist Van Aert who accepted the better man won.
""Carapaz stayed ahead very well. We knew he would be very, very strong, and he deserved the win,"" the Belgian, who pipped Pogacar to silver in a sprint finish said.
Britain's Adam Yates, who was part of the forlorn chase of Carapaz and finished ninth, paid tribute to his Ineos Grenadiers team mate.
""It's super for him. To be honest, I'm not sure where he won it off the front. It was a sneaky move but obviously worked really well and showed he's come out of the Tour flying,"" he said. ""Massive congratulations to him.""

The money will support organisations and programmes that narrow the gap in employment and education through partnerships, collaborations, grant giving and advocacy, a statement said.
The Mercedes driver's brand partners and sponsors will also be contributing.
""Mission 44 represents my commitment to create real change within this community,"" said the Briton, who could celebrate a record-extending 100th career win at this weekend's Hungarian Grand Prix.
""In my early life, I experienced first-hand how coming from an underrepresented background can affect your future but, luckily for me, I was able to overcome those odds through opportunity and support,"" sport's only Black driver said.
""I want to ensure that other young people from similar backgrounds are able to do the same.""
Hamilton has raced from early on with the number 44 on his car, rather than the number one reserved for a reigning champion.
Mercedes have launched a joint charitable initiative, Ignite, with Hamilton to support greater diversity in motorsport. That will sit under the Mission 44 umbrella.
A commission founded a year ago by Hamilton to help motorsport engage more young people from Black backgrounds issued its report this month.
Led by the Royal Academy of Engineering, it made 10 recommendations for change.
Among barriers to diversity were hiring from a select group of top universities, the rural locations of teams and systemic under-achievement in schools.
""The findings of The Hamilton Commission and its recommendations have provided us with a fantastic basis to begin our work,"" said Hamilton.
""Change within the industry is long overdue, but we are now firmly on the journey towards transforming it for the better.""
Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said Ignite would complement the team's own Accelerate 25 programme and bring more talent from under-represented groups into Formula One and the wider motorsport industry.

The Italian rider has an opportunity to join Spain's Miguel Indurain and Swiss Fabian Cancellara as an Olympic gold medallist in the time trial while still in possession of the world crown in the event.
Ganna, nicknamed 'La Bestia' - the beast - did not make the cut for Italy's Rio 2016 lineup, but has since picked up 10 professional time trial wins - including the 2020 world title on home soil and five Giro d'Italia stages.
Competing three days after his 25th birthday, Ganna cannot expect plain sailing when he rolls down the ramp at the Fuji International Speedway.
The Belgian duo of Wout van Aert, who won silver in Saturday's road race, and Remco Evenepoel will start as strong medal contenders along with Slovenian Primoz Roglic, while Dutchman Tom Dumoulin will be looking to upgrade his Rio silver.
Rohan Dennis, twice a world champion, also cannot be discounted, with the Australian skipping the Olympic road race at the weekend specifically to target this event.
These contenders will race against the clock over two laps of a hilly 22.1-km loop with the start and finish on the old Formula One racing circuit.
The route brings an elevation gain of 846 metres in total – and it is by no means a flat, power time trial for the purists.
Regardless of the result, Ganna's first Olympic campaign will not end on Wednesday as he will also take part in the men's team pursuit track cycling event next week.
Only three men have previously claimed a gold medal in multiple cycling disciplines at the same Olympic Games.
""I did a big block of work on the track before this year's Tour de Romandie,"" Ganna said on the eve of the Tokyo Games.
""I want this challenge of going to the Olympics and trying for two gold medals. I want to try it, and I believe in my possibilities.""

Red Bull's Verstappen and Mercedes' seven-times world champion Hamilton have gone wheel to wheel repeatedly, with the pair colliding on the opening lap of this month's British Grand Prix.
The reaction to that clash has triggered fears the battle could boil over, with Formula One's motorsport head Ross Brawn calling for calm heads after both sides traded accusations.
Australian Webber, winner of nine grands prix between 2009-12, was in favour of letting it all play out.
""It's brilliant, exactly what we want. I think it was one of the best first laps we've seen in a long time,"" he said on a video call for the women's W Series with female racer and compatriot Caitlin Wood.
""It's been coming, they've had some brilliant wheel-to-wheel battles in Barcelona, Imola, Bahrain and we all knew this was coming. Bring on more of it.""
Verstappen leads the championship by eight points after drawing a blank at Silverstone, where he crashed out and Hamilton won.
Webber said the sense of occasion had been extraordinary, with about 140,000 fans in attendance on race day and the two main contenders facing off from the front row.
The former Red Bull driver expected another treat at the Hungaroring this weekend in the final race before the August break.
""I think that Lewis is magical at Budapest, he's absolutely phenomenal at that track,"" said Webber. ""Mind you also Max is handy as well.
Hamilton has won a record eight times in Budapest with seven pole positions. Last year the Briton won from pole and also set the fastest lap.
""I think the Red Bull will be strong at that track, so Max could have a bit of a Red Bull Ring sort of weekend potentially - pole and then disappear, so Lewis might not get a punch on him,"" said Webber.
""Hamilton is going to need to be at his best again. Verstappen ... he's a gladiator. That's exactly what we expect of him.
""There probably, inevitably, will be some more carbon fibre between the pair of them going into the air but happy days. It's what we watch the sport for.""
Wood will also be in Budapest, the 24-year-old making her season's debut in the fourth round of the W Series that now supports Formula One.

The FIA will hear from Red Bull via video conference on Thursday (Jul 29) ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix. The team has been fuming since contact between Verstappen and Hamilton on the first lap of the British Grand Prix caused Verstappen to crash hard into a barrier and sent the Dutchman briefly to the hospital for evaluation.
Red Bull accused Hamilton of making a ""desperate” move to edge ahead of his rival on the first lap because the reigning champion knew getting ahead of Verstappen at the start was his only chance to win on his home track and tighten the championship race.
Hamilton was given a 10-second penalty for the incident but recovered to win for the first time in six races. It snapped a five-race winning streak for Red Bull and cut Verstappen's lead in the title fight from 33 points to eight.

The sport's most successful driver of all time is racing for Mercedes at the Hungaroring near Budapest this weekend in the 11th round of the championship that could bring him a record 100th career win.
""Ahead of the Grand Prix this weekend, I want to share my support for those affected by the government's anti-LGBTQ+ law,"" the Briton posted on Instagram on Thursday.
""It is unacceptable, cowardly and misguiding for those in power (to) suggest such a law. Everyone deserves to have the freedom to be themselves, no matter who they love or how they identify.
""I urge the people of Hungary to vote in the upcoming referendum to protect the rights of the LGBTQ+ community, they need our support more than ever. Please show love for those around you because love will always win.""
Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has been in power since 2010, has introduced social policies he says aim to safeguard traditional Christian values from Western liberalism.
The European Commission has launched legal action against Orban's government over the new law, which came into force this month, saying it is discriminatory and contravenes European values of tolerance and individual freedom.
A survey last month by the Ipsos polling organisation found that 46per cent of Hungarians supported same-sex marriage.
Orban announced a referendum last week on legislation that limits schools' teaching about homosexuality and transgender issues.
Hamilton, Formula One's only Black driver, has used his platform to campaign for a range of social issues, human rights and diversity.
He has said that while drivers have no say in where the sport races, it was right to speak out.
""I don't think we should be going to these countries and just ignoring what is happening in those places and arriving, having a great time and then leave,"" the 36-year-old said earlier this year.

Hamilton and Verstappen were battling for the lead on the opening lap of the race at Silverstone when they made contact into the fast, right-handed Copse corner.
The collision resulted in a 51G crash for championship leader Verstappen, with the Dutchman flown to hospital for precautionary checks.
Hamilton, deemed predominantly responsible for the incident by stewards, overcame a ten-second time penalty to win on home soil.

""It’s perhaps not reciprocated but that’s okay,"" added the 36-year-old , who is now eight points behind Verstappen in the overall standings and could draw level with him in Hungary.
The events at Silverstone added an edge to the rivalry between the sport's established star and his heir apparent. It also ratcheted up tensions between their teams.
Red Bull, whose motorsport adviser Helmut Marko called for a one-race ban for Hamilton, have asked for a review of the incident with personnel from the Milton Keynes-based team and Mercedes called to a video meeting with stewards on Thursday.

Hamilton was handed a 10-second time penalty but went on to chalk up a record-extending eighth win on home soil and slash his deficit to Verstappen in the overall standings to eight points from 33.
Teams can ask for a review of incidents in accordance with article 14 of the International Sporting Code if they discover significant and relevant new information unavailable to them at the time of the original decision.
Red Bull, feeling Hamilton had got off lightly, had sought a review in accordance with this article.
But the stewards, who have sole discretion to determine whether such a new element exists, ruled that the information presented by Red Bull at a meeting at the Hungarian Grand Prix on Thursday was not ""a significant and relevant new element discovered which was unavailable to the parties seeking the review at the time of the decision concerned.""
The Milton Keynes-based squad presented slides based on GPS-traces from both Verstappen's and Hamilton's cars driving through the right-handed Copse corner where the incident occurred.
GPS data showing the line Hamilton drove while pulling off a similar but successful race-winning move on Ferrari's Charles Leclerc into the same corner later on was included, as were lap simulations of the incident.
The team also submitted data from a reenactment of Hamilton's opening-lap racing line into Copse conducted by their reserve driver Alexander Albon last week.   
Stewards said this information wasn't ""discovered"" but ""created"" based on information that was already available to Red Bull at the time of the original decision. 
They also noted ""with some concern"" allegations made by Red Bull in their letter requesting the review. The allegations weren't made public. The Stewards chose not to comment on them, with the petition having been dismissed.

The Dutchman lapped the twisty 4.3km Hungaroring circuit on the outskirts of Budapest in one minute, 17.555 seconds, 0.061 seconds quicker than the Finn.
His championship rival Lewis Hamilton was 0.167 seconds off the pace in third for Mercedes, the Briton finding himself right behind the Ferrari of Charles Leclerc at the start of what should have been his fastest run.
Verstappen leads Hamilton by eight points in the overall standings after 10 of this season's 23 races.
The pair head into the weekend with tensions between them simmering after a controversial collision at the last race in Britain.
They could enter the sport's month-long summer break after Sunday's race level on points if Hamilton, gunning for a landmark 100th career victory and record ninth in Hungary, wins ahead of Verstappen with the fastest lap.
Carlos Sainz set the fourth fastest time for Ferrari on Friday ahead of AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly.
Fernando Alonso, who celebrated his 40th birthday on Thursday, was sixth for Alpine at the track where he scored his maiden Formula One win in 2003.
Leclerc was seventh ahead of Verstappen's Mexican team mate Sergio Perez.
Briton Lando Norris was ninth for McLaren ahead of Canadian Lance Stroll who rounded out the top 10 for Aston Martin.
The session, run on a hot and sunny morning, was briefly halted after Japanese rookie Yuki Tsunoda lost control of his AlphaTauri and spun into the barriers.

The pair collided on the opening lap of the race around the high-speed Silverstone track, with the contact putting Red Bull's Verstappen out of the race in a 51G crash that sent the Dutchman to hospital for precautionary checks.
Hamilton was handed a 10-second time penalty by stewards but the Briton still went on to win his home race for a record-extending eighth time and slash his deficit to Verstappen to eight points from 33 in the overall standings.
The Milton Keynes-based team, feeling Hamilton had got off easy, had asked stewards to review the incident but their petition was dismissed on Thursday ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix for lack of new evidence.    
Mercedes responded with a punchy statement, saying they hoped it would end Red Bull's attempt to ""tarnish the good name and sporting integrity of Lewis Hamilton"".
""We wanted to bring a little bit of respect back to the discussion,"" Wolff told reporters on Friday in a video conference from the Hungaroring track.
""We understand that emotions can run high. But we felt that line was overstepped.""
Red Bull team boss Christian Horner had criticised Hamilton's move as ""desperate"" after the Silverstone race, while the team's motorsport advisor Helmut Marko had called for the Briton to be handed a one-race ban. Verstappen described Hamilton and the Mercedes team's post-race celebrations as ""disrespectful"".
Wolff said Red Bull had elaborated on those criticisms in the submissions they made to stewards as part of their petition for a review.
""We felt the comments that were made during and after the race, and then in written statements and in the meeting itself were below the belt,"" he said.
""But it’s not up to me, nor would Lewis want to demand any apologies,"" he added.
Horner said Red Bull's criticism of Hamilton wasn't personal nor had they suggested the Briton acted deliberately. 
""If that had been any other driver the reaction would have been identical,"" he added, calling Mercedes' statement ""antagonistic"".

The Briton lit up the timing screens with a one minute, 15.419 second lap, 0.315 seconds quicker than team mate Valtteri Bottas, who locked out the front row for Mercedes.
Crucially it put the 36-year-old Hamilton 0.421 seconds clear of championship-leading Red Bull rival Max Verstappen who was a disappointing third.
“It was an amazing qualifying, that last one,” said Hamilton, who trails Verstappen by eight points in the overall standings amid jeers and boos from the Dutchman's fans, after taking his 101st career pole and first in six races.
“The guys at the factory have just not left any stone unturned. It's been amazing to see everyone coming together, rallying up and pushing forward.""
VERSTAPPEN TRAILS
The result handed Mercedes their first front-row lockout since the Portuguese Grand Prix in May, where Bottas took pole.
The once-dominant champions have faced stiff competition from Red Bull this season, with the Milton Keynes-based squad having usurped their German rivals as the team to beat over recent races.
Verstappen had started the last four races from the front but, with track temperatures hovering around the 60 degree Celsius mark, he was unable to stop Hamilton taking a record eighth Hungarian pole.
However, starting on the grippy but less durable soft tyres compared to Hamilton’s mediums, could give him an edge off the line.
“The whole weekend so far we’ve been a bit behind and it showed again in qualifying,” said Verstappen.
“Of course not what we want but nevertheless we’re still there in third and we’ll see what we can do.”
Hamilton will start Sunday’s race gunning for a landmark 100th career victory and a record ninth in Hungary. If he wins ahead of Verstappen with the fastest lap, he will go into the sport's summer break level on points with the Dutchman.
The 23-year-old will be determined to stop him, however, with the rivalry between the pair taking on an added edge after their collision at the last race in Silverstone.
HEIGHTENED TENSIONS
The heightened tensions were visible during the final part of qualifying.
Hamilton, ahead of Verstappen on track, drove a slow warm-up lap as the clock ticked down with both drivers crossing the line to start their flying laps with only seconds to spare.
But Sergio Perez in the other Red Bull missed out. The Mexican will start fourth alongside Verstappen on the second row.
Pierre Gasly was an impressive fifth for AlphaTauri ahead of McLaren’s Lando Norris and Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc.
Esteban Ocon was eighth for Alpine ahead of team mate Fernando Alonso, who turned 40 on Thursday.
Sebastian Vettel rounded out the top 10 for Aston Martin.
Qualifying was halted briefly when Spaniard Carlos Sainz spun off into the barriers during the second phase. He will start 15th in his Ferrari.
Mick Schumacher did not take part with the Haas team unable to repair his car in time after the German’s crash in final practice earlier on Saturday.

The Mercedes driver is locked in a fierce battle with Red Bull's world championship leader Max Verstappen, with passions running high after their collision at the previous race.
Plenty of Verstappen fans have made their way to Hungary for Sunday's showdown, the last before the August break, and social media posts showed one orange banner hanging from a stand declaring ""Sir Cheat: Karma is on its way""
Hamilton was recently knighted in Britain.
""I appreciate the great support I have here,"" said the sport's most successful driver of all time, smiling.
""Honestly, I've never actually felt so great with the booing. If anything, it just fuels me. So I don't really mind.""
The Silverstone clash dumped Verstappen out at speed while Hamilton, deemed guilty of dangerous driving by Red Bull, collected a penalty but still won, slashing the Dutch driver's overall advantage to eight points.
SLOW GOING
The Briton and Bottas, who joins him on the front row, were slow lapping before the final run as the clock ticked down to the end of qualifying with provisional times set already.
Red Bull's Sergio Perez was unable to get round in time for another lap as a result.
""Everybody was going slow. Did you not watch everyone else? I don't understand,"" Hamilton told reporters.
""Do you think I could have gone quicker and then just been closer to Valtteri?... I'm not playing any tactics. I don't need to play no tactics, man. I know what I'm doing in the car, I'm fast enough. I don't need to add tactics.""
Red Bull team boss Christian Horner, who was strongly critical of the Silverstone collision, was not getting hot under the collar about it.
Verstappen qualified third, with Perez fourth on the grid.
""It's a bit of gamesmanship,"" Horner told Sky Sports television when asked about the out-lap. ""Lewis had got a hell of a lap in the bank and then obviously he's just backing things up.

The duo were caught up in a war of words after Verstappen crashed out of the British Grand Prix and ended up in hospital following the collision.
Hamilton was handed a 10-second time penalty by stewards but the Briton still went on to win his home race to cut the Dutchman's lead in the championship standings from 33 points to just eight.
When a reporter tried to quiz Red Bull driver Verstappen on the fallout from that incident, he snapped: ""Can we just already stop about this?""
""We had so many questions about this,"" he added turning the air blue. ""It’s just ridiculous, honestly.""
The incident, which ratcheted up tensions between the two title protagonists, has dominated headlines in the build up to the Hungarian race.
Hamilton, gunning for a landmark 100th career win and record ninth in Hungary, qualified on pole on Saturday, his first in six races.
Verstappen, who has started the last four races from the front, will line up third behind Valtteri Bottas who locked out the front row for Mercedes.
But the Red Bull driver will be starting on the grippy soft compound tyre which could give him the edge off the line and allow him to challenge the medium tyre-shod Hamilton into the first corner.
The reporter was in the process of asking Verstappen and Hamilton about going wheel-to-wheel with each other again on Sunday when he was cut off.
""The whole Thursday we've been answering this all the time so can we just stop about it please?"" said Verstappen. ""We’re racers and of course we’re going to race hard but fair. So we just keep pushing each other.""

The Briton and Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas, who had provisionally locked out the front row, were lapping slowly ahead of Verstappen and team mate Sergio Perez in the build-up to their final flying laps, even as the clock ticked down to the end of qualifying.
Verstappen began his flying lap with just seconds left on the clock but Perez couldn't cross the line to start his final attempt before the chequered flag was waved.
""It's a bit of gamesmanship,"" Red Bull team principal Christian Horner told Sky Sports television when asked about the out-lap.
""Lewis had got a hell of a lap in the bank and then obviously he's just backing things up.""
Horner, strongly critical of Hamilton after his controversial collision with Verstappen at the last race at Silverstone, added that he had no problem with the 36-year-old's driving. He said Hamilton as the car ahead had the right to back the field up.
But the Briton, who was booed by Verstappen's orange-clad supporters immediately after qualifying, drew criticism from other quarters, with Frenchman Romain Grosjean who drove for the Haas team last year tweeting: ""If that was made on purpose, it's not pretty."" 
""Everybody was going slow. Did you not watch everyone else? I don't understand,"" Hamilton told reporters in the post-qualifying press conference when asked if he had backed Verstappen up on purpose.

The 24-year-old Ocon took the flag 1.8 seconds clear of Aston Martin’s four-time champion Vettel, who piled on the pressure on the Alpine driver but could not get past.
Hamilton, who put in a stirring drive to recover from a strategic misstep that dropped him from first to last, very nearly caught the pair up, but ran out of laps as he crossed the line 2.7 seconds behind in the final podium spot for Mercedes.
The Briton, however, can draw consolation from turning an eight-point deficit to Red Bull title rival Max Verstappen in the standings into a six-point lead.
The Dutchman scored a single point after finishing 10th having been caught up in an opening-lap collision.
The result also handed Mercedes a 10-point lead over Red Bull in the constructor standings.
FANTASTIC DAY
“What a moment, what a moment. It feels so good,” said an exultant Ocon, handing his Renault-owned team their first win in their Alpine guise and their first since the season-opening Australian Grand Prix in 2013 when they raced as Lotus.
“It’s the first victory since the Renault group came back into Formula One.
""It’s been a fantastic day,” added Ocon, who also became the first Frenchman to win in a French car since Alain Prost with Renault in 1983.
Starting eighth and 10th respectively, neither Ocon nor Vettel were thought to be remotely in contention for a race expected to play out as a straight fight between pole-sitter Hamilton and third-placed Verstappen.
But carnage on a wet opening lap and a strategy error wrong footed both title protagonists.
McLaren's Lando Norris smacked into the side of Verstappen's Red Bull after being tagged by the slow starting Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas, who went on to collect the other Red Bull of Sergio Perez, putting both cars out of the race.
That incident and a collision between Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc and Aston Martin's Lance Stroll brought out the safety car before the race was halted on the second lap.
Verstappen’s crew tried to repair his car during the interruption but the Red Bull had suffered far too much damage to bring the Dutchman, now in 13th, back into contention.
HAMILTON SETBACK
Hamilton suffered a setback of his own as he lined up alone for the restart on intermediate tyres on a bone-dry grid even as the rest of the field peeled off into the pits.
He pitted a lap later but came out last, scything through the field in a charge that saw him engage in a potentially race-deciding duel with Fernando Alonso, who finished fifth and was voted 'Driver of the Day' by fans.
“We always make it difficult for ourselves ... but these things happen and we learn from them,” said Hamilton, who was denied a landmark 100th career win and a record ninth in Hungary.
“I gave it everything and I had nothing left at the end,” added the Briton, who had to be looked over by the Mercedes team doctor after suffering fatigue and dizziness on the podium.

LONDON: Aston Martin will let the data decide whether they appeal Sebastian Vettel's disqualification from second place at the Hungarian Grand Prix, the Formula One team said on Monday (Aug 2).
The decision has a bearing on the title battle between Mercedes' seven-times champion Lewis Hamilton, who stands to inherit second place in the race, and Red Bull's Max Verstappen who would move up to ninth.
""We are now analysing data in order to decide whether to appeal or not,"" said a team spokesman on Monday.
Vettel, a four-times world champion, was disqualified after the governing FIA was unable to extract the required litre of fuel from his car post-race.
Aston Martin gave notice of their intention to appeal at the Hungaroring on Sunday night and have a 96-hour window to decide whether to take it any further or accept the loss of 18 points.
""Since we had reason to believe that there was more than one litre of fuel in Sebastian Vettel's car after the Hungarian Grand Prix, we decided to reserve our right to appeal"" said the spokesman.
Vettel's car has been sealed and impounded by the FIA, with Formula One about to start a three-week August break.
If Aston Martin do proceed, the outcome will also be closely watched by those further down the pecking order.
Former champions Williams scored their first points since 2019 on Sunday to go eighth overall and ahead of Alfa Romeo as well as Haas.
If Vettel is removed from the results, Williams would collect 10 points rather than six, a significant difference among tail-enders for whom every point is a struggle.
Haas principal Guenther Steiner, whose team have yet to score in 2021, was sceptical about the chances of any eventual appeal.
""Maybe in the procedure to get the fuel out, there is something,"" he told reporters on Monday. ""If there was only that amount of fuel, it's black and white. There is nothing in-between.
""I don't know if there was an issue to take the fuel out and they couldn't get everything out...""
Aston Martin boss Otmar Szafnauer said there should have been 1.74 litres of fuel left and suggested a problem with a pump. The data will show how much fuel went in and how much was consumed.",['689_0'],['\nSecond placed Sebastian Vettel of Aston Martin celebrates on the podium after the race.

The Briton has a long-term Mercedes contract and has been tipped to replace Valtteri Bottas as Lewis Hamilton's team mate next year. The team have said a decision will be taken over the August break.
The test at the Hungaroring will involve a Mercedes car fitted with 2022-specification 18-inch tyres.
It comes two days after Russell scored his first points for Williams with eighth place, subject to the outcome of a possible Aston Martin appeal, in the Hungarian Grand Prix.
Russell has tested for Mercedes previously at various locations, including the Hungaroring in 2017.
Ferrari and McLaren are also set to take part in the test.

The sport, once seen as a gas-guzzling, cash-burning fossil fuel playground for 'petrolheads', aims to be net zero-carbon by 2030 and has promised that all grand prix events will be sustainable by 2025.
Current grand prix cars use a highly efficient 1.6 litre V6 turbo hybrid power unit, and a new one due in 2025 will run 100per cent on sustainable fuels.
All-electric Formula E has attracted significant manufacturer interest but Rosberg, a shareholder in the city-based series, saw both FIA-sanctioned world championships co-existing as parallel peaks rather than rivals.
""The future of motor racing is sustainable,"" the German, who left Formula One after winning the title with Mercedes in 2016, told Reuters at the recent London e-Prix.
""You've got Formula E being the pinnacle of electric motor racing and then I think you'll have Formula One being the pinnacle of synthetic fuel motor racing.
""Both are very exciting paths and both can have a very positive impact on our world. And then in terms of mobility for all of us in our everyday use, it's going to be electric.""
   Rosberg, also has his own team in Extreme E - Formula E’s all-electric off-road sister competition - and has invested in numerous start-ups in sustainable mobility.
He is founder of the Greentech Festival, a showcase for green technology.
    ""Mobility is in an incredibly disruptive moment. It's very exciting what's possible. So we're going electric. We're going autonomous as well,"" said the German.
Formula One has been the auto industry’s incubator for motoring innovation for decades, a title now being claimed by Formula E with manufacturers like Jaguar, Mercedes, Nissan, Porsche, Mahindra and Citroen's DS brand.
Audi and BMW are leaving at the end of the 2021 campaign, however.
""We are definitely seeing what we're learning on track, being taken to the cars in the street,"" Nio 333 Racing’s team principal Christian Silk told Reuters in the pitlane.
    ""From the design of the batteries, the design of the electric motors to how we use the cars on track and how we use the cars on the street,"" said Silk.

The Briton suffered dizziness and fatigue after Sunday's race at the Hungaroring, the last before the August break, and said he suspected he was still feeling the effects of contracting COVID-19 in December.
""I guess you saw him on the podium struggling. I saw him about an hour after that and he was definitely a chunk better and I know he has recovered since then,"" Elliott said in a Mercedes debrief.
Hamilton has also posted pictures on Instagram of his workout sessions.
Elliott said drivers faced particularly extreme conditions in Hungary, sitting close to the ground in humid air that reached temperatures of 40 or 50 degrees Celsius.
""Lewis was really pushing on that two stop, some of the overtakes he was doing were absolutely brilliant. That takes a lot of energy out of you in that really hot environment,"" he added.
""He is now going to have a break over the shutdown and I am sure he will come back really strong for the second half of the season.""
Hamilton has turned a 33 point deficit to Red Bull's Max Verstappen into an eight point lead, depending on the outcome of an Aston Martin appeal against Sebastian Vettel's disqualification from second place.
Sunday's race was won by Alpine's Esteban Ocon after a chaotic opening lap, with Hamilton and team mate Valtteri Bottas one-two on the grid.
Hamilton won the race before that, a home one at Silverstone, after a run of five wins in a row for Red Bull.
Elliott said the team had been ""enthused and energised"" by the last two races, while recognising luck had gone in their favour.
""I think for me, what's really encouraging is the pace we have shown in the last two races... to qualify one and two and by a reasonable margin, that's the strongest position we have been in so far this season,"" he added.
""The rest of the season is definitely going to be tough, it is going to be a real fight. I think it is going to be one of those classic F1 seasons...""

Four-times world champion Vettel finished second at the Hungaroring on Sunday, behind Alpine's Esteban Ocon, but was disqualified after the governing FIA was unable to extract the required litre of fuel for post-race checks.
Aston Martin said its data indicated 1.74 litres remained in the car.
It added in a statement that it had ""requested a right of review alongside the appeal procedure, as a result of having discovered significant new evidence relevant to the sanction which was unavailable to it at the time of the FIA stewards' decision.""

Red Bull were embroiled in a bitter 'flexi-wing' controversy  that led to the governing FIA issuing a technical directive and introducing more stringent load deflection tests on rear wings.
There have also been plenty of insults and angry exchanges between team principal Christian Horner and Mercedes counterpart Toto Wolff, with Red Bull recruiting engine experts from the German manufacturer as they plan their own power unit.
Newey, who has designed a string of title-winning cars in his decades in the sport, said it was a compliment in many ways for the team to come under such close scrutiny from their rivals.
""We have experienced this before but I can’t remember a time when we have received the same level of behind the scenes politicking and lobbying against our car,"" he told the team website http://www.redbull.com.
Red Bull won both championships for four years in a row between 2010-13 and also came under intense scrutiny then as well.
""That is the nature of Formula One, and one of the things that makes it so stimulating, but it is the frequency and intensity of this year that is quite telling,"" said Newey.
Red Bull have won six races to Mercedes' four, with Dutch youngster Verstappen taking five of those and Hamilton all of his team's. 
There are, provisionally at least, 12 more races to come between Belgium at the end of August and Abu Dhabi in mid-December.
Verstappen has suffered collisions with Mercedes drivers in the last two races, crashing out at Silverstone after a clash with Hamilton and punted off in Hungary when Valtteri Bottas triggered mayhem.
Verstappen managed to salvage some points with a damaged car in that last race but is now eight points behind Hamilton, after being 33 up going into the British Grand Prix.
The recent misfortunes have also left Red Bull a provisional 12 points behind Mercedes, pending an Aston Martin appeal, in the constructors' standings after being 44 ahead.
Newey said Red Bull had born the brunt of the flexi-wing focus, even though other teams had similar aerodynamic solutions.
""When Mercedes started making noise about it, they weren’t worried about what Alfa (Romeo) were doing,"" he said. 
""They were only worried about whether we were getting a benefit, which we really weren’t, but there was a cost implication to changing that part which obviously hurt.""

The sport has planned a record 23-race championship in 2021, with 12 still to come.
""I think once we come out of the summer break (F1 chief executive) Stefano (Domenicali) will know what hand he's been dealt in some of these remaining territories and the schedule will go into place,"" Brown told Reuters.
There remains uncertainty about the Japanese Grand Prix scheduled for Oct. 10, which if cancelled could also affect a race in Turkey on Oct. 3.
Turkey is on Britain's red list of countries, meaning returning travellers must spend 10 days in hotel quarantine. By going on to Japan, which is on the amber list, that requirement would be avoided.
Mexico and Brazil, due to host races in October and November, are also on Britain's red list. Seven of the 10 Formula One teams are based in England.
Brown said there was talk of holding two races in Austin, Texas, but that situation was also fluid.
""I'm hearing that but I'm also hearing a lot of different scheduling scenarios. I think the reality is no-one probably definitively knows,"" he said.
""I think it is a bit of a chess game of what happens in this market and it goes on the red list, or what have you, and there's a domino effect. I've heard a variety of scenarios.""
Brown hoped the success of the Tokyo Olympics, which ended on Sunday and featured more than 50,000 people operating within a closely-controlled bubble, would boost the Formula One race at Suzuka.
""From what I can tell there hasn't been any drama that's broken out from the Olympics so to me it does seem that would raise the confidence,"" said Brown.
""I think they have said it will probably be a closed door event and I think Formula One has shown we as an industry are very good at travelling in and out of countries safely. So I'm confident we as Formula One can put on a safe event.
""What you don't know is the state of play in the country itself.""

The German, a four-times world champion, was stripped of second place after a required litre of fuel could not be extracted following the Aug. 1 race won surprisingly by Alpine's Esteban Ocon.
The disqualification meant Mercedes' seven-times world champion Hamilton inherited the position and gained two extra points in his battle with Red Bull rival Max Verstappen. 
It also lifted Ferrari to third place overall, ahead of McLaren, and boosted Williams' points haul to 10.   
The team still have a separate appeal outstanding and said they were considering their position.    
The stewards said after a video hearing that Aston Martin had discovered a malfunctioning fuel system, ""which would have resulted in the ejection of fuel during the race"", was to blame.
Aston Martin had previously said there should have been 1.44 litres left in the car, according to their calculations.
""In the original decision, the stewards only assumed the fact that there was not enough fuel in the tank. The question of what caused that situation was left out of consideration,"" the stewards said, explaining their decision.
""The F1 Technical Regulations unequivocally calls for a remaining amount of one litre and does not allow any exceptions under which circumstances or for what reasons it could be dispensed with.""
Aston Martin had requested the review on the grounds that they had discovered ""significant new evidence"" which had been previously unavailable to them.
This turned out to be analysis of more than 100 channels of fuel system-related data, which stewards accepted had brought a new element to light in the failure of the fuel system.
They added, however, that this was not relevant to the decision.
""In order to be able to affirm a 'relevant' fact, Aston Martin would have had to present facts that actually more than one litre of fuel was remaining,"" the statement said. 
""The explanation why this requirement could not be met is not relevant to the decision as to whether a breach of the regulations has occurred.""

""Giovinazzi remains our reserve driver... he's growing every year and I hope he can stay at Alfa, he deserves it.""
There has been some speculation that Schumacher, 22-year-old son of Ferrari's seven times world champion Michael, might move up to Alfa, who have been more competitive than tail-enders Haas.
Ferrari are third overall in the championship after 11 races, level with McLaren on points but ahead on placings. 
Binotto said that was the most that could be hoped for, with Mercedes and Red Bull in a battle of their own for the titles.
Ferrari will have a boost on the engine side later in the year but not before the next two high-speed races in Belgium and Italy.
""We will have an evolution of the power unit further ahead, not at Monza,"" said Binotto.
""The rules allowed us to introduce a new unit at the start of the season but we just changed some parts. So we can make some changes which will help in a significant way and can foreshadow the 2022 power unit.""   
Formula One engine manufacturers can make one upgrade of each component per year.

F1 is set to return to the Zandvoort circuit in the dunes west of Amsterdam for the first time since 1985 next month, but organisers have warned of financial problems if the number of fans are limited due to coronavirus measures.
""I'd say the glass is two thirds full"", organiser and former Formula One driver Jan Lammers said.
""We have decided to invest in the future of Formula One in the Netherlands. We will simply go ahead.""
With its return to the picturesque Zandvoort circuit, Formula One is trying to make the most of the popularity of Dutch driver Max Verstappen, who is battling Lewis Hamilton for the overall championship.
Current COVID-19 measures in the Netherlands allow for stands at sporting events to be filled at two thirds of their capacity. For Zandvoort this means around 70,000 spectators per day will be allowed at the track. 
The race in the Netherlands was cancelled in May last year due to the coronavirus pandemic, and has been challenged by numerous activists who say the expansion of the track is damaging the neighbouring nature reserve.
Activists on Friday said they had filed a new demand at the district court of Haarlem to suspend the license for the race, as they said nitrogen emissions due to the event would be much higher than organisers had said in their application.
A spokesman for the activists said the court would decide on the demand before the first weekend of September.

Japan's MotoGP, which was also scheduled to take place in October, was scrapped in June.
The cancellation of the Japanese GP is especially disappointing to Honda who will be deprived of a last farewell in front of their home fans before withdrawing from the sport at the end of the season.
Honda engines currently power Red Bull and its sister team Alpha Tauri.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen is currently second in the world drivers' championship, engaged in a thrilling tussle with Lewis Hamilton whose Mercedes team are also edging the constructors' championship.
Honda is also, via a subsidiary, owner of the Suzuka circuit which has hosted the Japanese GP since 2009.
""It is unfortunate that, for a second consecutive year, it has not been possible to hold the Japanese Formula 1 Grand Prix at Suzuka,"" the team said in a statement.
""As Honda, we are particularly disappointed, because this is the final year of our Formula 1 project and we know that so many fans were looking forward to attending the event.""
The figure-of-eight Suzuka circuit, which will celebrate its 60th anniversary in 2022, has hosted 31 GPs since 1987, with the drivers' world title being decided there on 11 occasions.
In April, Japanese GP promoters and F1 chiefs announced that the race would remain at Suzuka until 2024.
Japan has just hosted the Olympic Games, with no spectators allowed in the stadiums, and is preparing to do the same, under similar conditions, for the Paralympic Games, which begin next week.
Since the end of June, the country has been experiencing its worst wave of coronavirus to date, due in particular to the Delta variant.
A state of emergency has been re-established since mid-July in part of the country, including the capital Tokyo, for the fourth time since the beginning of the pandemic.
But the system, which was extended on Tuesday, seems to be losing its effectiveness. Daily cases of COVID-19 continue to increase and exceeded the 20,000 mark across the country for the first time on Friday and Saturday.",[],[]

The announcement comes three days after Dutch driver Nyck de Vries won the Formula E world championship title after finishing eighth in the season's final race in Berlin, with Mercedes also winning the teams' title after Stoffel Vandoorne's third place.
""Mercedes-Benz today announced that it will conclude its ABB FIA Formula E success story as a team entrant and manufacturer at the end of Season 8, in August 2022,"" the manufacturer said in a statement https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/eq-formulae/we-race-the-city/team/team-news/concluding-formula-e-success-story.
""Moving forward, the company will concentrate its works motorsport activities on Formula 1, reinforcing the sport’s status as the fastest laboratory for developing and proving sustainable and scalable future performance technologies.""
In December, German manufacturers Audi and BMW confirmed they would exit Formula E at the end of this year.
Mercedes announced a new strategic direction for its brand in July, with the aim of going all-electric by the end of the decade.
""As part of the new strategic direction, the brand has deliberately chosen to shift resources for this accelerated ramp-up of electrification, including the development of three electric-only architectures to be launched in 2025,"" the carmaker said.
""Therefore, Mercedes will reallocate resource away from its ABB FIA Formula E World Championship programme and towards applying the lessons learned in competition to product development in series.""

Public Health England said 2,295 people were likely to have been infectious with a further 3,404 people potentially acquiring infection at the Jul 11 match.
""Euros final was superspreader event,"" declared the Times newspaper.
The match, with a crowd of around 67,000 inside the stadium, was England's first final in an international soccer tournament since the country hosted and won the 1966 World Cup.
""Euro 2020 was a unique occasion and it is unlikely we would see a similar impact on COVID-19 cases from future events,"" said Jenifer Smith, Public Health England's deputy medical director, in a statement.
""However, the data does show how easily the virus can spread when there is close contact and this should be a warning to us all as we try and return to a cautious normality once again.""
Other trial events over a four-month period showed far fewer positive tests, and were either broadly in line with or lower than national averages.
The British Formula One Grand Prix at Silverstone in July drew a 350,000-strong crowd, the largest in Britain in more than 18 months, over three days and had 585 cases recorded by NHS Test and Trace.
Of those cases, 343 were likely to have already been infectious around the time of the event and the rest likely to have acquired an infection then.
The Wimbledon tennis championships, with around 300,000 people attending over the two weeks, recorded 881 cases.
""We've shown that we can reintroduce mass sports and cultural events safely but it is important that people remain cautious when mixing in very crowded settings,"" said Culture Minister Oliver Dowden.

The Red Bull driver saw a 33-point lead over his Mercedes rival turn into an eight-point deficit in just two races after a controversial race-ending collision with Hamilton at Silverstone and a ninth-place finish due to an unfortunate first-corner tangle in Hungary sapped his title charge of momentum. 
A win around the sylvan sweeps of the seven-kilometre Spa-Francorchamps circuit is just what Verstappen, winner of five races this season to Hamilton's four, needs to get his championship challenge back on track with 12 rounds to go.
It would also be a fitting way to celebrate Red Bull's 50th race with engine supplier Honda.
""I am of course excited to go back to Spa; it’s my favourite track and it’s really cool to drive with so many high-speed corners and elevation changes,"" said the 23-year-old who has twice retired from the Belgian race and never finished higher than third.
""I’m also looking forward to seeing all the fans who will be coming to support us and it will be cool to see so much orange in the grandstands again as they couldn’t be there last year.
""I also think it is a good place to reset our championship fight and I’m well prepared and feeling good ahead of the weekend,"" he added.
The race around the Spa-Francorchamps track, which is just across the border from the Netherlands and is usually thronging with orange-clad fans, has always been something of a local race for Verstappen who was born in Belgium to a Belgian mother.
His supporters are expected to pack the stands again this weekend, despite Verstappen's home Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort returning to the calendar the following weekend.
Organisers have capped capacity at 75,000 fans per day due to COVID-19, with the event held behind closed doors last year. Attendance is limited to citizens of Europe and the United Kingdom.
The Belgian Grand Prix, which marks Formula One's return from its month-long summer break, is the first of a 'triple-header' of races taking place on consecutive weekends.
Verstappen dominated Formula One's last triple header earlier in the summer, winning the French Grand Prix and the two races on Red Bull's home soil in Austria.
Hamilton, who has won four times in Belgium and is chasing an elusive 100th grand prix win this weekend, will be determined to seize the initiative this time around.
His Mercedes team, who also now lead the overall team standings, are looking forward to the battle.
""We head to Spa-Francorchamps in a good position,"" said team boss Toto Wolff.
""We lead both championships and the W12 feels in a better place after the upgrades introduced at Silverstone and an encouraging showing in Hungary.""

The 40-year-old Spaniard, who had teased a ""big announcement"" in a coded message on Twitter on Wednesday, will continue to race alongside Frenchman Esteban Ocon who was handed a fresh three-year deal by the Renault-owned team earlier this season.
""I’m very happy to confirm the contract extension with Alpine F1 Team into 2022,"" Alonso, who won both his championships with the Enstone-based team when it raced as Renault in 2005 and 2006, said in a statement ahead of this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix.
""I felt at home the moment I returned to this team and have been welcomed back with open arms.""
Alonso, winner of 32 races, made his Formula One comeback this year after two seasons out during which he competed in the World Endurance Championship and the Dakar rally.
He played a pivotal role in securing team mate Ocon's maiden win at the last race in Hungary by holding up the charging Mercedes of Lewis Hamilton. His fourth-place finish in that race was his best result of the season.
The Spaniard is currently 11th in the overall standings with 38 points.
""Fernando has impressed us all since he returned to the sport at the beginning of this year,"" said Alpine CEO Laurent Rossi.
""His performance in Hungary was another example of his racing pedigree and reminded everyone how skilled a driver he is.""
Alonso's contract extension was widely expected.
Alpine who are now fifth in the overall standings are looking to next year, when a major rules overhaul aimed at encouraging closer racing and a more restrictive budget cap could level the playing field, as an opportunity to move up the field.
Alonso is hoping to lead their charge.
""It’s been a tricky season for everyone, but we’ve shown progress as a team and the result in Hungary serves as a good example of this progression,"" said Alonso.
""I have been a big supporter of the need for a level playing field and change in the sport and the 2022 season will be a great opportunity for that.""

Bottas, the incumbent and twice championship runner-up, and Mercedes-backed Williams driver Russell were put up together as the drivers met the media by video conference at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit.
""There is no news to share, yet,"" declared Bottas, who said before the August break that he wanted his future sorted by Spa.
""Who knows? Maybe I know something, maybe I don't. But, like I said, there's no news to share.""
Asked whether that was because the decision had not been made or now was not the right time to announce it, the Finn repeated the line and said he had no need to clarify.
""We have a job to do here and there's no news. We're going to focus on racing and getting maximum points,"" he added.
Russell, the 2018 Formula Two champion, repeated the same 'no news to share' line.
""There's nothing to announce one way or another this weekend, and probably not next weekend either,"" added the 23-year-old.
""I think it's no problem. Everything is, you know, do things right rather than quickly.""
The choice of driver for one of the hottest seats on the starting grid is eagerly awaited by fans, with Russell tipped by many to get the nod. 
Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff was quoted by The Times newspaper this week saying he had delayed making a call because the situation was so complicated.
Seven times world champion Hamilton has been strongly supportive of Bottas, with the Finn proving an easy team mate to get along with in his 4-1/2 seasons since replacing 2016 champion Nico Rosberg.
""It's not an easy decision because we know about the qualities of Valtteri's personality, his character, the integration in the team, the driver development of the car and his speed,"" said Wolff. ""He deserves to race at Mercedes.
""On the other side, George has done this three years at Williams and shown great, great promise and he deserves to have the chance to be in a competitive car at the front of the grid.""
Russell filled in for Hamilton in Bahrain last year, when his fellow-Briton tested positive for COVID-19, and was unlucky not to win.
Hamilton, now 36 and leading Red Bull's Max Verstappen in this year's championship ahead of Sunday's race, is signed up for two more years.

The 22-year-old has raced at Spa before on his way up to Formula One and even drove a demonstration lap around the circuit in his father’s Benetton in 2017. 
But this weekend will be the first time he drives a Formula One car around its seven km sweeps in F1.
""The track is one of the most historical tracks in Formula One,"" said Schumacher, who made his debut at this year’s season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix with American team Haas.
""Personally as well for me it’s one of the most fun tracks to drive on.
""Definitely looking forward to just driving and enjoying my time out there,"" he added.
The Spa-Francorchamps circuit is synonymous with Schumacher senior’s career.
The German, who referred to it as his “living room”, made his Formula One debut at the track on the same weekend in August 1991.
He took his first Formula One win at the circuit a year later, clinched his seventh title at the venue in 2004 and also celebrated his 300th grand prix there in 2012.
He has also won at the track six times, more than any other driver.
For Mick, the track holds special memories from his own fledgling racing career.
“I had my first pole position, my first race win in 2018 here with F3 which then became a streak of multiple race wins,” he said.
Schumacher who retired from Formula One at the end of 2012, with a then unprecedented 91 wins, seven titles and 68 pole positions, has not been seen in public since suffering severe head injuries in a skiing accident in December 2013.
Netflix released a trailer for a documentary on the life and career of the seven-time champion earlier this week.
Approved by his family and set to premier on Sept. 15, Mick said 'Schumacher' would be an emotional watch.
“A lot of people when they were growing up they’ve obviously watched my dad. For me it’s been very emotional to see it.
“The best thing I can say is for everybody to... just watch it and experience it for themselves.
“I don’t really want to spoil too much.”

The German four-time champion crossed the line behind Alpine's race-winning Frenchman Esteban Ocon to take what should have been his second podium finish for new team Aston Martin in the Aug. 1 race.
But he was excluded after his car was found not to have the mandatory litre of fuel to provide a post-race sample, elevating Mercedes' championship leader Lewis Hamilton to second.
""It’s very bitter because, first, we did not have an advantage, second, there was no intention or no way that we could actually explain that too little fuel was in the car,"" the 34-year-old told reporters via video conference at the Belgian Grand Prix.
""Looking back I think it’s clear - the rules are as they are and we got disqualified.
""Looking forward ... I understand better because I was the one who suffered from it, you don’t wish that to anyone else to happen and it should probably have a little bit more tolerance.""
Aston Martin, seventh out of 10 teams in the overall standings, also lost out on crucial points in the midfield constructors' battle.
They initially sought a review of the disqualification. The request was dismissed by stewards and the Silverstone-based squad subsequently withdrew their appeal, believing that proceeding with it outweighed the benefits of it being heard.
Vettel, who has 122 career podiums but has finished in the top-three just twice since his win in the 2019 Singapore Grand Prix for Ferrari, said he had at least had a chance to go up on the podium to celebrate - albeit ultimately in vain.

The Briton has an eight-point lead over his Dutch rival ahead of the Belgian Grand Prix, a race that starts the second phase and will have plenty of vocal Verstappen fans in attendance.
""It’s going to be close, it’s going to be tough this second half of the season,"" said Hamilton, who could take a record-extending 100th win on Sunday.
""The first half was definitely one of the toughest and I expect it’s going to be pretty much the same in the second half, if not more difficult.""
The 36-year-old said he was excited to get back, had missed working with the team and being in the car and did not feel more wary of Verstappen's challenge.
Verstappen has won five races to Hamilton's four so far this year and would be comfortably ahead but for collisions and misfortune that have left him with only five points from the past two races.
""As we've got through the season they have got stronger and stronger,"" said Hamilton, whose team have won the last seven successive drivers' and constructors' world championships.
""It’s been harder for us as we have gone on, we had a bit of a difficult patch but we got back in terms of operating to how we have in the past.
""We have definitely upped our game ... I have no doubts that we will take another step forward in our processes and how we apply ourselves.""
Hamilton's health caused concern at the previous race in Hungary when he feared he might be feeling the effects of 'long COVID' after testing positive for the virus in Bahrain last November.
He was reluctant to divulge personal health information on Thursday but said he had spent the break ensuring he was in better shape and it was no longer a concern for him.
Hamilton has won four times previously at Spa, the longest track on the calendar and one of the fastest, while Verstappen is seeking a first at what was a home circuit before the Dutch Grand Prix was reinstated.","['666_0', '666_1', '666_2', '666_3', '666_4']","[""\n      Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton in the FIA Press Conference.

The 25-year-old stayed home in Queensland in 2020 as COVID-19 spread around the world but she returned to the tour this year to claim Wimbledon and four other titles.
Now in New York warming up for the U.S. Open starting Monday, Barty will meet Vera Zvonareva in the first round.
With Australia's strict quarantine rules quashing any hope of a quick trip home to recharge, Tyzzer said Barty's five months away had been a struggle at times.
""It hasn't been easy. It's certainly been really tough to be away for that long and continue to keep playing and be fresh,"" he told Reuters from New York on Friday.
""We've been trying to do our best to get all those things right. Sometimes we have, sometimes we haven't.
""But she's been really consistent just in her ability to play and front up for all the matches. She should be really proud of what she's done so far this year.""
In a departure from the norm of elite players who relentlessly chase ranking points and prizemoney, Barty has taken two long and voluntary breaks from the sport.
Fed up with the grind of touring as an 18-year-old, she quit for a year-and-a-half and became a professional cricketer before returning to tennis in 2016.
She came back strong from that break, too, winning her first WTA singles title in Malaysia and soaring into the top 20 by the end of 2017.
When asked if resting for long periods before returning to dominate might be the ideal model for Barty's remaining tennis career, Tyzzer said: ""I think if she had another long time at home, she probably wouldn't come back.
""She loves being at home, loves her family and the lifestyle of Australia. (But) I don't think it's a great formula to have her off for too long.
""When she's playing a lot of tennis, she's at her best.""
TRUE NUMBER ONE
Though resting for almost all of 2020, Barty was able to hold on to her world number one spot courtesy of a rankings rejig after the WTA Tour was suspended for five months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
As U.S. Open champion Naomi Osaka stormed to the Australian Open title in February, questions were asked as to who was the true number one.
There is no debate now. Barty is more than 3,000 points clear of world number two Aryna Sabalenka in the rankings, with number three Osaka further adrift after opting out of Wimbledon.
Barty's maiden Wimbledon title was the fulfilment of a girlhood dream and she admitted on Sunday she was still processing it.
Tyzzer, however, said Barty was already setting other goals.
""Obviously she'd like to hang onto the number one spot and keep pushing to hold onto it as long as she can,"" he said.
""We've got a Grand Slam around the corner so there's another goal for her.""
A Grand Slam winner on grass and clay, Barty will look to win her first hardcourt major at Flushing Meadows, where the raw power of Osaka has reigned two of the last three years.
Barty is more of an all-court player than a straight baseline pounder like Osaka, but the Australian's game is also suited for hardcourts, said Tyzzer.
She would relish a showdown with Osaka should both reach the U.S. Open final.

The Dutchman, looking to revive his title challenge after seeing a 33-point lead turn into an eight point deficit behind Mercedes rival Lewis Hamilton in the last two races, spun into the barriers with two minutes left on the clock in an incident that brought out the red flags and put an end to the session.
The 23-year-old Verstappen, however, had already lapped the seven-km Spa-Francorchamps circuit in one minute, 44.472 seconds which stood as the fastest time of the day.
Finn Valtteri Bottas, who beat the Red Bull driver to the fastest time during the opening hour of practice, was second for Mercedes. Hamilton, who is gunning for a landmark 100th win this weekend but ended the first session 18th, recovered to third.
The top three were separated by just 0.072 seconds.
Verstappen lost control of his Red Bull as he turned into the right-handed Malmedy corner before nudging backwards into the barriers.
There did not appear to be too much damage but replays showed the Dutchman trying to tear off sponsor hoardings that had become tangled up with his car's rear wing.
Moments earlier Ferrari's Charles Leclerc had forced a brief halt to the session when he crashed into the barriers close to the scene of Verstappen's incident.
RACE SIMULATION
Teams were focused on high-fuel race simulation runs when Verstappen went off and the fastest times had already been set.
Double world champion Fernando Alonso, handed a one-year contract extension by Alpine, announced on Thursday, was fourth quickest ahead of AlphaTauri's Frenchman Pierre Gasly.
Lance Stroll was sixth for Aston Martin with Esteban Ocon, winner of the last race in Hungary, seventh.
Sebastian Vettel, who was disqualified from a second-place finish in Hungary, was eighth in the other Aston Martin.
Lando Norris was ninth for McLaren while Mexican Sergio Perez, who Red Bull announced on Friday will be staying at next year, rounded out the top 10.
Mick Schumacher followed in his seven-time champion father Michael Schumacher's footsteps by making his Formula One appearance at the Spa circuit 30 years on from the German great's F1 debut at the same venue.
The Haas driver, sporting the same helmet design worn by his dad on that weekend, was 20th.
Friday's practice sessions marked Formula One's return to track action after its annual summer break.
The Belgian Grand Prix is the first of a 'triple-header' of three races on successive weekends.

Perez joined Red Bull from Racing Point, now Aston Martin, and won in Azerbaijan in June - his second F1 victory after the 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix in Bahrain.
The 31-year-old qualified on the front row in his second race for Red Bull at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix and is currently fifth overall.
Verstappen, who has a contract to the end of 2023, is eight points behind Mercedes's seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton in the championship while Red Bull are challenging for the constructors' title.
""Checo (Perez) is a highly respected team member and his experience and race-craft are invaluable as we fight for the constructors’ championship,"" said team boss Christian Horner at the Belgian Grand Prix.
""His integration into the wider team has been seamless and we have been impressed by his performances during the first half of the season which demonstrates what he’s capable of in our car.""
The announcement also means British-based Thai racer Alexander Albon will not be making a quick return to the seat he vacated last year.
Perez has made 202 starts in a career that includes stints at Sauber, McLaren and Force India and his experience will be an asset as Formula One moves into a new era with revised regulations next year.
""I’m really happy to be continuing with a great team like Red Bull into the new era of Formula One and it’s a great opportunity for me,"" he said.
""Everyone starts from zero next year with the new regulations, so my only goal is to go all the way to the top with Red Bull.""

""Yeah, looks like I would say,"" the German said when asked if the praise he had heaped on the 26-year-old in response to an earlier question during a video conference at the Belgian Grand Prix meant the team were going to offer him a contract.
""He’s a very good race driver and he deserves the seat in our team definitely.""
Latifi made his Formula One debut with the former champions last season alongside George Russell.
He has generally been outperformed by the Briton, especially in qualifying, but finished seventh ahead of the 23-year-old at the last race in Hungary with the pair handing the former champions their best result since 2017.
The result also handed Latifi his first Formula One points.
With Russell in the frame to replace Finn Valtteri Bottas in the seat alongside  seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes next season, the Canadian on Thursday said he was ready to take on a leadership role at Williams. 
""He works very well with the engineers, he is very motivational, he’s very clear in his direction where he wants the car to develop, he is very much liked by the team and he is demanding,"" said Capito. 
""I think also he learned a lot with George as they worked together... and I’m sure by the end of the season Nicky will be in that position that he can lead the team.""
Capito said the uncertainty over whether Russell would be moved up to Mercedes or not, with both the Briton and Bottas on Thursday insisting they had no news to share, was not a concern for Williams.
""I think (Mercedes team boss) Toto (Wolff) will take the decision sooner or later,"" said Capito.
""I believe it will be sooner.
""But the Williams seat seems to be an attractive seat for every driver who hasn’t got a fixed seat for next year.
""As most of the seats are fixed for next year, we can lean back and wait what the decision is and when the decision is taken we can get into more detailed discussions with various drivers.""

The Dutchman scythed through the spray in one minute, 59.765 seconds with George Russell, having fended off the third-placed Mercedes of championship leader Lewis Hamilton, falling just 0.321 seconds short of a shock maiden pole in his Williams.
Widely tipped to join Hamilton at Mercedes next year, Russell's efforts put the Grove-based team back on the front row and kept the seven-time champion from starting alongside his Red Bull title rival.
""We needed that,"" Verstappen, who trails Hamilton by eight points in the overall standings after his 33-point lead was wiped out in just two races, said over the team radio.
""It’s been a really tricky qualifying, hard to keep the car on track,"" added the 23-year-old in a television interview later.
""But at the end we were first, that’s of course the most important.""
The pole was the ninth of Verstappen's career and sixth this season. He will be happy to have Russell as a buffer between him and his Mercedes rival.
The 23-year-old Briton, keen to make his case for a Mercedes promotion, will not be holding back even if his Williams cannot  match Verstappen and Hamilton's cars in race conditions.
""That’s the plan,"" said Russell, who handed Williams their first front row start since 2017, when asked if he would make a bid for the lead at the start.
""If it’s there for the taking we’ll go for it.""
Hamilton, who is gunning for a landmark 100th win, appeared to be on the back foot with his car set up with less downforce. That could work in his favour on Sunday, especially if track conditions are dry.
""I think we tried to strike the best balance possible,"" said Hamilton.
""Maybe it’s not the best for today but we will see tomorrow exactly how good it is.""
The start of qualifying was delayed by rain. The session was then halted for about 40 minutes with just nine minutes of the final pole-position shootout to go after a heavy crash for McLaren's Lando Norris.
The Briton, who had led the session's opening two phases of qualifying, was the first driver to attempt a flying lap in the final part of qualifying. 
With the rain having intensified, his McLaren snapped out of control while going through the fast, uphill sweep at Eau Rouge and slammed into the barriers.
Norris, who jumped out of the car, was taken to the medical center for precautionary checks and has been cleared to race.
His team mate Daniel Ricciardo offered McLaren some consolation by going fourth.

The formation lap, which kicks off proceedings, was initially delayed by 25 minutes but after two laps behind the safety car in poor visibility, with the field kicking up plumes of spray even at that relatively slow speed, Formula One's race director Michael Masi decided to suspend the start procedure.
Drivers and teams milled about in the pitlane and as the rain continued to fall the focus turned to whether the race would get underway at all.
""In my personal opinion if it continues like that you can't start,"" Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff told Sky Sports F1.
""It's just too dangerous through Eau Rouge, Raidillon and on the straight. As much as I love racing and I love also the risk of racing, this is maybe a step too far.""
Formula One has a three-hour window for a race to take place written into the rules.
But stewards, declaring ""Force Majeure"", stopped the clock counting down to that limit, buying them more time to get underway a race which otherwise would have been called off at 1800 local time (1600 GMT).
Two laps, even if they are run behind the safety car, will be enough for drivers to be handed half points.
Pole-sitter Max Verstappen, who trails championship leader Lewis Hamilton by eight points, would in that case be declared the winner and take home 12.5 points. 
George Russell, who starred in a wet qualifying on Saturday when he put his Williams on the front row, would finish second and get nine points, while Hamilton in third would score 7.5 points, which would see his championship lead reduced by five points to three.
The two formation laps initially run behind the safety car would not count.
Two-thirds of the race distance, or about 29 of the Belgian Grand Prix's 44 laps, must be completed for drivers to be eligible to score maximum points.
Postponing the race to Monday could pose logistical headaches, with Zandvoort scheduled to host the return of the Dutch Grand Prix next weekend.
""Postponing, let's see,"" said Wolff. ""Yeah, I think it's going to be very difficult with Zandvoort. It's all very complex these days.""
Conditions had deteriorated well before the start and Sergio Perez crashed out on a sighting lap before even lining up on the grid.
The Mexican, who has been given a contract extension for next year, appeared to be out on the spot, in a blow to Red Bull's hopes in their constructors' title battle with Mercedes.
However, the stewards said Perez would be allowed to start the race from the pitlane, with the former champions, who are 12 points behind Mercedes in the standings, taking advantage of the delay to complete repairs.
That could all be in vain, though, if the race is abandoned or called after two laps behind the safety car.","['659_0', '659_1', '659_2', '659_3', '659_4']","['\n      Formula One F1 - Belgian Grand Prix - Spa-Francorchamps, Spa, Belgium - August 29, 2021 General view of the safety car and drivers as the start of the race is delayed due to bad weather REUTERS/Christian Hartmann\n    ', '\n      Formula One F1 - Belgian Grand Prix - Spa-Francorchamps, Spa, Belgium - August 29, 2021 A television camera operator shelters from the rain as the race is delayed due to bad weather REUTERS/Johanna Geron\n    ', ""\n      Formula One F1 - Belgian Grand Prix - Spa-Francorchamps, Spa, Belgium - August 29, 2021 Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton with drivers before the race as the race is delayed due to bad weather Pool via REUTERS/John Thys\n    "", '\n      Formula One F1 - Belgian Grand Prix - Spa-Francorchamps, Spa, Belgium - August 29, 2021 Spectators in the rain as the race is delayed due to bad weather REUTERS/Johanna Geron\n    ', ""\n      Formula One F1 - Belgian Grand Prix - Spa-Francorchamps, Spa, Belgium - August 29, 2021 Red Bull's Sergio Perez crashes out before the start of the race REUTERS/Johanna Geron\n    ""]"

Stopped in the 29th of 54 laps at the Oesterreichring due to rain. The late Italian Vittorio Brambilla took the only victory of his Formula One career and was so excited that he spun into the barriers after taking the chequered flag.

The wet race at Spa-Francorchamps was abandoned after the field, circulating behind the safety car, completed the two laps necessary for half-points to be awarded and commercial obligations to broadcasters and others fulfilled.
""Money talks and the two laps to start the race is all a money scenario,"" seven times world champion Hamilton, who finished third for Mercedes, told Sky Sports after the podium ceremonies.
""So everyone gets their money and I think the fans should get theirs back too. Because unfortunately they didn't get to see what they paid for.""
The Briton said he was really disappointed for the crowd but the conditions were impossible for racing.
""Obviously we can't control the weather, and I love racing in the rain, but today was something else. You really couldn't see the car ahead, there was aquaplaning, it was unfortunately just a disaster on track,"" he said.
""But the fans stayed out in the rain. They still had energy, they still created the atmosphere but they were robbed of a race today. I think they deserve their money back.""
Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said everyone had reasons to be upset.
""It is what it is. I guess you need to take this one on the chin and close the chapter on this race and move on,"" said the Austrian.
""We must really applaud the fans that have been there for three days in the rain, they have waited for a race to happen.""
With no overtaking possible, pole sitter Max Verstappen was declared the winner for Red Bull ahead of Williams driver George Russell.

With no actual racing allowed, the Dutchman secured his sixth win of the season ahead of Britain’s George Russell, who had put Williams on the front row with a stunning display in a wet qualifying on Saturday.
Championship leader Lewis Hamilton, who again missed out on the chance to secure a record-extending 100th win, was third for Mercedes.
It was only the sixth time since the first championship in 1950 that half points had been awarded, and Hamilton's lead over Verstappen in the overall standings dwindled to just three points.
Red Bull also cut their deficit to Mercedes in the constructors’ standings to seven.
""Its a big shame to not do proper laps but the conditions were very tricky out there,” said Verstappen after sealing what will count as his 16th career win and first at Spa.
“Of course it’s a win but it’s not how you want to win.""
Hamilton said the fans, who sat huddled for three hours in the torrential rain and cold, should be given their money back.
Russell, in his 50th race with Williams, secured his first Formula One podium and handed the former champions their first top-three result since Canadian Lance Stroll’s third-placed finish in Baku in 2017.
“We don’t often get rewarded for great qualifyings and we absolutely did today,” said the 23-year-old, widely tipped to land the Mercedes seat alongside Hamilton next year.
“The whole team deserve it because there’s so much hard work going into this over the last few years and there’s not really been anything to show for it.”
POOR CONDITIONS
Conditions at Spa-Francorchamps had begun deteriorating before the start of the race.
The formation lap was initially delayed by 25 minutes but, with visibility poor, Formula One race director Michael Masi suspended the race start.
After nearly three hours, race control found a window to send the cars out for two laps behind the safety car, ensuring they completed the minimum distance required for a race result to be declared.
The governing FIA's final race classification, however, gave the positions after lap one, explaining that this was in accordance with the sporting regulations.
The race was ultimately called off three hours and 44 minutes after its scheduled start time and will also go down in the sport's statistics as only the 11th without a single retirement.
Mexican Sergio Perez crashed his Red Bull on his sighting lap before even forming up on the grid but stewards allowed him to start the race from the pitlane, with Red Bull mechanics taking advantage of the delay to complete repairs.
It proved to be in vain as the 31-year-old was classified last.
Hamilton’s Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas, who started 13th after a five-position grid drop, moved up a place after Perez’s crash. He finished outside the points in 12th.

Sunday's race, the shortest in Formula One history, was abandoned after drivers completed the minimum laps behind a safety car needed to declare a result, following a lengthy rain-enforced stoppage.
That allowed the Briton, who had put his Williams on the front row on Saturday, to keep second place behind Red Bull race winner Max Verstappen without a single lap of racing.
""It actually counted,"" said Russell, who earned his 'Mr Saturday' tag thanks to his giant-killing qualifying performances.
""The whole team deserve it.
""There’s so much hard work going into this over the last few years and there’s not really been anything to show for it,"" added the 23-year-old, who is widely tipped to replace Valtteri Bottas at champions Mercedes.
Russell has progressed beyond the opening knockout phase of qualifying at all but one of this season's 12 races. He has made it into the final pole-position shootout three times, including in Belgium where he secured a place on the grid ahead of championship leader Hamilton.
But Russell only took his first points finish for Williams at the last race in Hungary. 
Former champions Williams, who have finished at the bottom of the overall standings for the last three years, have also been making progress. 
Sunday's result, for which they earned half points, was their first top-three finish since Canadian Lance Stroll's third place finish in Baku in 2017. 
But the Grove-based team are still eighth in this year's constructors' table, making Russell's Belgian qualifying heroics all the more impressive.
While Russell felt sorry for the fans who sat huddled in the torrential rain only to see the field briefly circulate behind the safety car, he did not let the circumstances dampen his joy at being on the podium.
""We don't often get rewarded for great qualifyings and we absolutely did today,"" he said.

Just calling it a race takes a mighty stretch of the imagination - a delay of more than three hours with crowds enduring cold and rain to see a few processional laps behind the safety car in heavy spray and no overtaking.  
Officially, the action lasted all of three minutes and 27 seconds with Red Bull's Max Verstappen the winner - a result effectively decided in Saturday's qualifying.
Half points were then handed out for only the sixth time ever.
""If you want to get a reward for qualifying you should get points for qualifying,"" said Aston Martin's four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel.
""If there were actually no race laps, no competition, why should points be given and any result be given, because there was basically no race,"" asked Ferrari's Carlos Sainz, who finished 10th.
""I didn't race, so I didn't deserve the half a point I got, so I don't know why I got it.""
The rules say at least two laps are necessary for a race to become official and half points awarded but Sunday's solution came across as a cynical box-ticking exercise to some and plain wrong to others.
The champagne was sprayed but, apart from George Russell appearing on the podium for the first time for Williams with second place, there was little to celebrate.
Seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton, who finished third, said the fans had been robbed and should get their money back. 
He later took to Instagram to call it a 'farce'.
""We should have just called it quits,"" he added.
McLaren boss Zak Brown called for the rules to be overhauled to prevent such a situation happening again.
""We wanted to race, our drivers wanted to race and of course we know you wanted to see a race,"" Brown told fans in a video posted on Twitter. ""And that's not what you saw, that's not what we participated in.
BETTER SOLUTION
""The regulations state that after you do a few laps it can be called a race. I think that needs to be reviewed... we need a better solution as a sport when that type of situation happens,"" he added.
""The outcome should not be a race after three laps behind a safety car... I don't think anyone would say today it felt right calling that a race.""
Comparisons were drawn to the 2005 U.S. Grand Prix at Indianapolis, where only six cars started after Michelin-shod cars withdrew for safety reasons and went on to score full points.
That at least went the distance, and overtaking was possible - at least in theory although Ferrari's Michael Schumacher was never threatened by team mate Rubens Barrichello and they were in a different league to the Minardis and Jordans.
On Sunday there never seemed any question of racing, given there was poor visibility due to the weather conditions and no sign of improvement.
""They knew when they sent us out at the end there that the track wasn’t any better and they did it just so we could start two laps behind the safety car,"" said Hamilton.
""There was no point at which we could race so there wasn’t a race.""
FIA race director Michael Masi insisted commercial factors would never play a part in any decision regarding track conditions or racing.
He said also that postponement to Monday had not been an option, with the Dutch Grand Prix following next weekend, and insisted there had been a hope the race might start.
Any commercial motives were also rejected by Formula One chief executive Stefano Domenicali.
""There was really the will to do the race,"" said the Italian. ""But the problem is that the weather started to be even worse... So it's not really commercial on that, I can guarantee you.""

""In my view, there is only one decision for Mercedes next year with regards to the second seat,"" Brawn, now Formula One's managing director for motorsport, wrote in a column on the formula1.com website.
The 23-year-old Briton stood out in qualifying at Spa when he got on the front row of the Belgian Grand Prix grid for Williams, a team who this month scored their first points since 2019.
The 2018 Formula Two champion then made his first podium appearance by finishing second when the race was declared after three laps behind the safety car due to the wet conditions and poor visibility.
Russell had already stood out for fine qualifying performances in an otherwise uncompetitive car and as a stand-in for seven-times world champion Hamilton in Bahrain last season.
He is expected to replace Valtteri Bottas, with the Finn out of contract at Mercedes. Team boss Toto Wolff said on Sunday a decision had been made.
""We all know George Russell has a fantastic talent. We have seen it a lot at Williams, and we saw it amplified at Mercedes, when he stood in for Lewis Hamilton at the Sakhir Grand Prix last year,"" said Brawn.
""George’s performance reminded me a lot of Fernando Alonso when he drove at a wet Spa for Minardi in 2001. He was mighty impressive in a car that clearly was not up to the job.
""In those conditions, the ratio of driver to car changes - and we saw that with George on Saturday.

McLaren Racing chief executive Zak Brown told Reuters change was overdue and the situation was discussed in Belgium last weekend.
He hoped something could be done in time for the Sept 10-12 Italian Grand Prix.
""It was a topic this weekend and (F1 chief executive) Stefano (Domenicali) and the FIA acknowledge this and suggested they are going to come back and make some further changes. I think the sport is going to react,"" he said.
""Now that it’s been tabled and discussed and all the teams agree that we need to start loosening it up, I’d like to think maybe we could get something done for Monza.""
Brown, who had COVID-19 in July, suggested Formula One needed to look at what some other sports and series were doing and move in line with government policy in countries the sport visited.
""We all think this (COVID-19) is going to be here for a long time now so everyone’s starting to learn how to deal with it and live with it responsibly and I think that’s what we need to do,"" he added.
""We still pretty much have almost the same protocols as when this was going on a year ago. It’s started to loosen up but I think we need to make sure we’re taking care of our corporate partners.
""I think I should be able to go up to the Paddock Club, socially distanced, and talk to my guests and bring the drivers up. And on a limited basis bring the partners down to see the car in the garage, socially distanced.""
Formula One teams are operating in a protective 'bubble' to reduce the risk of contagion. 
They can bring key sponsors and others into the paddock inner sanctum only within their total allocation of 115 passes and guests cannot come and go from the elite Paddock Club hospitality.
Brown pointed out that the paddock was ""pretty much vaccinated"" and golf's PGA Tour and the U.S.-based IndyCar series had now stopped regular COVID-19 testing for all participants.
He questioned why vaccinated staff or a driver should still have to isolate, with a potential impact on the championship, if a close contact tested positive when that is not government policy in some countries.
Formula One sources said the sport was still a long way off ending its testing regime.

The rain-hit race at Spa-Francorchamps was only the sixth in Formula One history to award half-points.
The sporting regulations say this can happen ""if the leader has completed more than two laps but less than 75per cent of the original race distance"".
FIA President Jean Todt confirmed the rules were being reviewed.
""The FIA, together with Formula One and the teams, will carefully review the regulations to see what can be learned and improved for the future,"" the Frenchman said in a statement on Twitter.
""The findings, including the topic of points allocation, will be added to the agenda of the next F1 Commission meeting on October 5.""
Todt said the race had presented ""extraordinary challenges"" and the windows in the weather predicted by forecasters had not materialised.
He said he was sorry for the spectators who waited for hours in the wet and cold but the existing regulations had been correctly applied.
The race was Formula One's shortest ever, with Red Bull's Max Verstappen taking the win and 12.5 points to cut Lewis Hamilton's lead to three.
Several teams and drivers questioned the decision to award points when there had been no actual racing.
Alfa Romeo, one of the biggest losers after rivals Williams took 10 points thanks to George Russell's second place and Nicholas Latifi's ninth, were particularly aggrieved.

649,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/formula-1-alpine-open-keeping-alive-alonsos-triple-crown-dream-2148191,Formula 1: Alpine open to keeping alive Alonso's Triple Crown dream,"LONDON: Renault-owned Alpine could one day help Fernando Alonso achieve his dream of winning the Indianapolis 500 to complete the Triple Crown of Motorsport, according to company boss Laurent Rossi.
The Frenchman - a huge fan of the 40-year-old Spaniard - told Reuters the sportscar brand had discussed potential projects, even if far down the road, with the double Formula One world champion.
""It could be something we would consider especially if Fernando retires (from F1) and the timing is good and we have a car,"" said Rossi when asked about Indianapolis after mentioning the Triple Crown.
""We could do it, we could pull it off. And we would consider it with a very keen eye because we owe Fernando a lot and it would be good for the brand as well.
""Even though we are not necessarily present in those (US) markets it’s something that’s always good for the brand.""
Alpine, now the umbrella for all Renault's racing activities, was at Le Mans this year with a re-badged car and is deciding whether to make a full commitment to endurance racing.
That could be with a Hypercar in the Le Mans LMH category or under NASCAR-owned IMSA's LMDh rules when there is convergence from 2023.
""LMDh now allows us to race in IMSA and so it could be interesting if we were to choose that path to have Fernando, who is a seasoned endurance driver, reinforce our already strong team,"" said Rossi of what the future might hold.
Alonso, who has won both the Le Mans 24 Hours and Monaco Grand Prix twice, said last week when his Alpine contract was extended for 2022 that Indianapolis would always be on his wish list.
A victory in the 500 would make him only the second driver, after the late Briton Graham Hill, to win the F1 title or Monaco along with Le Mans and Indianapolis.
Alonso made his debut at The Brickyard in 2017 with the support of McLaren, his then employers in Formula One, in an Andretti Autosport car.
Alpine already have some connection to IndyCar with the Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing team providing a car for Danish academy driver Christian Lundgaard in a race at Indianapolis this month.
Rossi said Alonso, who won his F1 titles with Renault in 2005 and 2006 and is making a comeback this year after two seasons out, had been fantastic to work with and a true professional.
""I would love to have 20 people like him, demanding excellence and delivering performance in return,"" he said.
Alonso finished fourth in Hungary in August, holding off Mercedes's seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton for 11 laps, and Rossi said the Spaniard had shown he was still one of the best and could go on for some time yet.
""The guy is a true legend of the game. If he performs this way next year it will be almost a professional mistake for me not to carry on with him,"" he said.
""Why would I not consider that? It’s a luxury for me to have Fernando Alonso at this level of performance.""
Alpine are fifth overall in the constructors' standings but Esteban Ocon won in Hungary and a new spirit of optimism can be sensed.
Rossi said the current car had plateaued but the team had learned from mistakes and were prepared for a new era starting in 2022.

Djokovic, looking to become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win all four slams in the same year, beat Holger Rune 6-1 6-7(5) 6-2 6-1 to advance to the second round after the 18-year-old Danish qualifier ran himself into the ground against the world number one.
Fans chanted ""Rune"" throughout and applauded the young Dane's bravery as he played on despite being hampered by cramp.
After wrapping up victory Djokovic did not deliver his customary post-match celebration - sharing his heart with all four sides of the court - and he later said he thought the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd had been booing him.
""I didn't know what they were chanting honestly. I thought they were booing,"" Djokovic said at a news conference.
""I don't know, it was not ideal atmosphere for me ... But I've been in these particular atmospheres before, so I knew how to handle it.
""It's the largest stadium in sport. Definitely the loudest and the most entertaining stadium we have in our sport ... Obviously you always wish to have crowd behind you, but it's not always possible. That's all I can say."" 
A three-time U.S. Open champion, Djokovic was playing his first match at Flushing Meadows since his disqualification from last year's tournament when he inadvertently hit a line judge with the tennis ball in his fourth round.
A fourth U.S. Open trophy would take him ahead of his great rivals Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal in the Grand Slam count, with the trio all on 20 titles.
""There are things that you can always rely on, go back to when you are experiencing a little bit of a turbulence in terms of emotions on the court or off the court,"" said Djokovic. 
""When it gets too much, then I've developed a mechanism where I feel like I can mentally handle that.
""I do have a formula for many years that has worked well for me, that got me to where I am. At the same time, it's not necessarily a guarantee that it will work every single time.""

Tickets for the first Dutch Grand Prix in 36 years have been snapped up in the rush to see Red Bull's exciting young title contender race for the first time on home soil as a Formula One driver.
The race's return was postponed last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic but is going ahead this time with around 70,000 daily spectators sure to make their voices heard.
The old-school circuit in the dunes of the beach resort, a short journey from Amsterdam, will be just the place for the 23-year-old Verstappen to wrest the championship lead from Mercedes's Lewis Hamilton.
Verstappen has six victories to his credit from 12 races but is still three points adrift of the seven-times world champion, who will be venturing deep into hostile territory in search of a record-extending 100th career win.
Verstappen's win at Spa-Francorchamps was not one to celebrate, coming after a couple of laps in atrocious, wet conditions behind the safety car and the race declared, but Zandvoort will be very special.
""It was amazing to see so many fans supporting us in Austria and Belgium and I hope we can put on a good show for everyone in the grandstands this weekend,"" said Verstappen.
""As for the track, it might be a little hard to overtake on but for single-lap performance I think it’s going to be rewarding.
""The qualifying laps will be very quick there so any mistakes will be really costly.""
The undulating track, with banked corners, has short straights and limited overtaking opportunities but it could throw up some surprises with most drivers having no more experience of it than in the simulator.
Mercedes boss Toto Wolff, whose team lead both championships but with Red Bull closing the gap, looked forward to moving on from a miserable weekend and fighting for a proper victory.
""We're relishing the challenge of tackling a new track because it is new for everyone and that means fresh opportunities to find advantage,"" he said.
""We'll be looking to hit the ground running on Friday and take the fight to our competitors. It will be exciting to see who comes out on top.""
The last winner in the Netherlands was Austria's late triple champion Niki Lauda in a McLaren one-two with Frenchman Alain Prost.
While the battle looks likely to be between the two title contenders, McLaren's Lando Norris will want to make amends after crashing in Belgian qualifying while setting the pace initially.
""Zandvoort is a cool circuit and one that I've raced, and won, at before, back in 2017 in Formula Three,"" he said. ""The track has changed quite a bit since then, with new banking, which could change how the race plays out.""",['647_0'],"[""\nRed Bull's Max Verstappen in action.

Max-mania will reach fever pitch in the small beach resort west of Amsterdam as a sell-out crowd of around 70,000 orange-clad fans per day will roar Verstappen on as he aims to become the first Dutchman to win a home grand prix.
""We could have sold over a million tickets"", circuit director Robert van Overdijk said on the eve of the event, which was cancelled last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The sensational rise of Max Verstappen, the youngest grand prix winner and the first Dutch contender for the championship, has already painted the stands at races in Belgium and Austria orange, and his welcome promises to be even warmer on home soil.
However, many Dutch are not so thrilled by the return of racing's top class, which they say endangers Zandvoort's precious dune reserve and runs counter to efforts to fight climate change.
Over the past two years, environmentalists and animal rights groups have launched a range of lawsuits in a bid to block the race.
All cases so far were lost, but this has not deterred the activists, who are still seeking ways to block future races.
A last effort was dismissed by a court this week, but only on procedural grounds as the activists' claim that organisers have underestimated the air pollution caused by the race is already being dealt with by a higher court.
""The decision only related to the 2021 race and said nothing about the merits of our case"", environmentalist leader Johan Vollenbroek said.
""Everything is still possible for the coming years.""
But Van Overdijk said he did not fear the legal battles down the road, as he remains convinced that any environmental damage caused by Formula One could always be compensated by limiting other events throughout the year.
""This will not endanger the grand prix,"" he said. ""We are in it for the long run. We expect this to be the first of at least 10 or 15 editions of the Dutch grand prix.""

The 23-year-old Briton is expected to move from Williams and join compatriot Hamilton for 2022 in place of Finland's Valtteri Bottas.
Russell, whose career has been managed by Mercedes, told reporters at Zandvoort ahead of the Dutch Grand Prix that he knew where he would be racing next year and had been informed before last weekend's race in Belgium.
Hamilton's language left little doubt Russell had got the nod.
""I honestly think it will be good,"" the champion said when asked how the relationship with Russell might be. ""I think George is an incredibly talented driver.
""Probably the only highlight from last week was his qualifying lap, it was amazing,"" he added, referring to Russell putting the Williams on the front row at a wet Belgian Grand Prix and finishing second.
The race at Spa lasted for only a handful of laps behind the safety car.
""He's humble, I think he's got a great approach. Naturally being British I would imagine probably helps in terms of communication,"" continued Hamilton.
The Mercedes driver said he had to be 'super-supportive' of Bottas as his current team mate, with the pair fighting for the constructors' championship, but Russell represented the future.
""He's already showing incredible driving so far and I’m sure he’s going to continue to grow, so where better to do it than in a great team like this - or what team he goes to,"" said Hamilton.
The Daily Mail reported this week that Hamilton was far from happy with Russell becoming his team mate and quoted a 'well-placed source' saying the decision had gone down ""like a lead balloon"".
The older Briton said on Thursday, however, that he felt he had nothing to prove.
""If it does turn out that I've got a different team mate, I'm in a different place in my life,"" he said. ""I'm excited to see the youngsters coming through.
""It's not that I want to lose to a youngster but I'm excited to see the progression of the sport ... I see a lot of myself in the younger generation.
""There will be things we learn from one another. I think it's important that the respect is always there and communication will be at the core of that.""
Russell stood in for Hamilton in Bahrain last season, a race the youngster was unfortunate not to win.
""When you start with someone new it takes time. Even when we have a new engineer or a new mechanic it takes a moment for them to gel in,"" said Hamilton.
""George has already been on the circuit with us, he’s already done a race with the team, he’s already been in the background while Valtteri and I have been working in the past. So I think he knows the environment well.""","['645_0', '645_1']","[""\n       Williams' George Russell during the FIA Press Conference.

""This is a very fast track, the average speed will be very high"", former Formula One driver and Zandvoort native Jan Lammers told Reuters on the eve of the event.
""The newly introduced banked curves especially make it truly unique. There is no other circuit like it in Formula One.""
Race organisers spent about €15 million (US$18 million) on overhauling the picturesque circuit in the dunes 25km west of Amsterdam, which for decades was a fixture of F1 but had been shunned as outdated since the mid-1980s.
The most striking new elements in the 4.259km circuit are two steep banked curves, one of which leads to the finish straight and is specifically designed to allow drivers to hit top speed sooner before they reach the line.
Many drivers are looking forward to hitting the curves but expressed doubts about the possibilities to overtake on the old-school track, which leaves little room for error.
""It will be hard to overtake"", Lammers said. ""But it won't be impossible, and Monaco has shown that a race can also be exciting without many possibilities to overtake.""
The prospect of limited passing opportunities will increase the pressure on Saturday's qualification and poses a challenge for mechanics who will have to balance the effects of the banked curves and the fact no driver has yet raced the new track.
""It will require extra skills in the set-up of the car"", Lammers said.
""It's always a compromise between going for the fastest lap and focusing on the length of the race. In the end, most teams will likely go for the fast lap and it will be interesting to see who will find the best solution.""","['644_0', '644_1']","['\n      General view of the circuit, the Dutch Grand Prix should have returned to the Formula One calendar in 2020 but was cancelled following the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) the race is now due return in 2021.

Some 70,000 fans will be at Zandvoort every day this weekend and Hamilton, three points clear of his Dutch Red Bull rival in the standings, can expect a hostile reception.
Hamilton, who arrived at the seaside circuit somewhat provocatively on Thursday wearing an entirely orange outfit and told reporters that the colour suited him, said it was to be expected.
""I've never been someone that would go to an event and boo but you understand it,"" said the Mercedes driver when asked about some other races where Verstappen fans have been present in numbers.
""You see it at football events. It's just the passion that the fans have, or the dislike that some of them have for their opponents.
""I respect it ... I know I do have some Team LH fans in the Netherlands, there will probably be a small portion in the grandstands out there and I admire them for being able to withstand the boos too.""
Hamilton, who maintained British F1 fans did not boo, said he would aim to turn the negative energy into a positive ""and try and put it into the driving.""
Verstappen has won six of the 12 races so far to Hamilton's four but has suffered from incidents, including a first lap collision between the pair at Hamilton's home race in July - won by the Briton.
The two have shown plenty of respect for each other on and off track, while racing hard, and Verstappen said that while he could not condone the booing he could do nothing to stop it either.
""When you go to a football match, you come into a home ground and the opposition will be booed at some point and it’s not up to the local club to go onto the speakers and say ‘guys you cannot boo’ because it will naturally happen,"" he told reporters.
""I don’t think it’s up to me to say guys you cannot boo because I am not them and I have to just focus on what I’m doing on the track.
""I’m pretty sure most of them are here for a great weekend to see cars racing and of course some of them will boo but I cannot decide for them.

The 21-year-old Honda-backed rookie has scored in five of the 12 races so far and is 13th in the championship but 36 points behind ninth-placed French team mate Pierre Gasly.
Asked ahead of the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort whether he was confident of being at the team in 2022, Tsunoda took his time to reply.
""50-50,"" he replied. ""It was really up and down, it was not a very consistent season. I think I need to have more consistency.""
Tsunoda, Japan's sole current driver, said he did not know when an announcement was to be expected.
Although Red Bull's engine providers Honda are leaving Formula One at the end of the season, the Japanese manufacturer will continue to assemble the two teams' engines in Japan next year.   
Red Bull also have British-born Thai Alexander Albon, who was at their main team last season until Mexican Sergio Perez replaced him, under contract and competing in the German Touring Car (DTM) series.
Recent paddock speculation has suggested Albon could end up at Williams, however.

Almost 25,000 fans on Friday opted to use a bicycle for a large part of their journey to the track, 25 kilometres (15 miles) west of Amsterdam, organisers said, while some 27,000 took the train, as nearly all cars were banned from the small beach resort.
Hosting the first Dutch Formula One Grand Prix in 36 years, with fans desperate to watch home driver Max Verstappen, posed a serious challenge to organisers: how to get up to a hundred thousand people a day to a small beach resort that has only two access roads?
The answer proved simple: don't let cars in.
The town of little more than 17,000 people on the North Sea coast closed its two inland roads, forcing fans to choose other modes of transport.
They were urged either to take the train, or leave their car at one of several designated parking areas in the wider region and use one of thousands of pre-reserved rental bikes to travel the last 10 to 30 kilometres to the track.
""Mobility was one of our main concerns once it became clear Formula One could return to Zandvoort,"" circuit director Robert van Overdijk told Reuters.
""It is great to see that the plan we imagined over two years ago works and pays off.""
A Verstappen fan from the southern town of Venray said on the train to Zandvoort that the traffic plan seemed to work beautifully. 
""You wouldn't want to see the traffic jams they might have had without it,"" he said.
""We drove two hours, our wives dropped us at the station for the last half hour ride and tonight they'll pick us up again there."" 
Over 300,000 tickets for three days of racing sold in an instant on the back of the enormous popularity of Verstappen, the first Dutch grand prix winner and the nation's first contender for the championship.
Due to COVID-19 restrictions 70,000 fans are now allowed to attend every day.

By Alan Baldwin
:Red Bull boss Christian Horner expressed concern on Friday that rivals Mercedes could block a bid to bring Alexander Albon back to Formula One next season, with seats opening up at Alfa Romeo and Williams.
Mercedes are also keen to place their newly-crowned Formula E champion Nyck de Vries and Williams, who are interested in British-born Thai driver Albon, use the German manufacturers' engines.
""We're working hard to get him (Albon) a seat,"" Horner told Sky Sports television at the Dutch Grand Prix.
""I really hope that Mercedes don't block his opportunity at Williams. That would be a great, great shame.""
Horner explained that would be because of his links to Red Bull. ""It would be a great shame if a driver were to pay the penalty for that. Hopefully that won't come to play,"" he added.   
If no race seat was forthcoming, Albon would continue in a test and reserve role, added the boss.
Albon, 25, drove for Red Bull last year but lost his seat to Mexican Sergio Perez, now confirmed for 2022 alongside Max Verstappen. The Thai has since raced in the German Touring Cars (DTM) series.
Horner said Williams and Alfa Romeo had expressed ""a lot of interest"" in Albon and hoped something could be sorted within days.
""I think his preference would be Williams,"" he added. ""But obviously there's a few hurdles. He's had about four phone calls telling him not to go there from the team next door (Mercedes). I told him to ignore them."" 
DRIVER SHAKE-UP
With Alfa Romeo's Kimi Raikkonen retiring at the end of the season and Williams' George Russell lined up to replace Valtteri Bottas at Mercedes, Formula One is braced for a driver shake-up anyway.
Bottas is expected to replace Raikkonen but there are doubts about the second Alfa seat, currently occupied by Italian Antonio Giovinazzi with engine provider Ferrari having a say on who fills it. 
Albon is driving an AF Corse Ferrari in the DTM with sponsorship from Red Bull's AlphaTauri. Williams boss Jost Capito has worked closely with Red Bull in the past while head of Volkswagen Motorsport.
Asked whether Albon might be released from his Red Bull contract, Horner said there was flexibility.
""We'll accommodate whatever we can to ensure that he's back in a race seat next year,"" he said.
De Vries has also been linked to Williams and Alfa but Mercedes motorsport head Toto Wolff said Albon was key to events.
""At the moment it revolves around Alex Albon who, as Christian says, deserves a seat,"" said the Austrian. ""He's a really good kid and he's probably the main protagonist in the moving chairs."" 
""Nyck has a guaranteed seat in Formula E with us and I'm in two minds. I wish him to be in Formula One but I don't want to lose him for our Formula E campaign.""

Red Bull's home favourite and title contender Max Verstappen, with tens of thousands of orange-shirted fans packing the grandstands, was second in the morning session and then fifth in the afternoon.
Mercedes' seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton, who is three points clear of his Dutch rival, was fastest in a red-flagged and disrupted opening session before his car broke down  in the second.
""I just lost power and so they told me to stop,"" said Hamilton. ""It's not the end of the world. ""It's been a beautiful day, it's amazing to see the crowd, so many people here.""   
The breakdown brought out red flags, with a further stoppage caused by Haas's Nikita Mazepin going into the gravel.
Leclerc's fastest lap of one minute 10.902 seconds was 0.154 quicker than Sainz, with Alpine's Esteban Ocon third.
""It was really enjoyable to see all of them in orange and having fun in the grandstands,"" said Verstappen of his home reception.
""There's a few things we need to understand better to get a bit more pace out of it but it's also not very representative because my lap was on a used set (of tyres) and the lap I had to abort I think would have been good enough for first.""   
FIREMAN VETTEL
More than 35 minutes of the opening hour at the seaside circuit were lost after Sebastian Vettel's Mercedes-powered Aston Martin suffered a power unit failure and stopped, leaving  a trail of oil. 
Vettel grabbed a fire extinguisher as smoke came from the back but the car appeared to remain electrically live and could not be removed until it was declared safe by a marshal in protective clothing.
By the time the process was complete, only six minutes remained and a roar went up from the crowd as the cars returned to the track in a final rush.
Hamilton lapped in 1:11.500 with Verstappen 0.097 slower, after losing time in traffic, and Sainz third and 0.101 off the pace.
AlphaTauri's Yuki Tsunoda had an early spin that ended his involvement. 
All three days have been sold out, with 70,000 spectators allowed to attend on each and nearly all supporting Verstappen or his team at an old-school track with some standout banked corners.
The 23-year-old Dutch driver is by far the most successful in his country's Formula One history, the youngest ever race winner and the first to challenge for the title. He is three points behind Hamilton after 12 races.
A plane was spotted overhead during the session trailing a banner declaring '7xWDC. Simply lovely. #TeamLH' in support of Hamilton.
The Sun newspaper reported that one of the Briton's fans had paid 1,600 pounds (US$2,211) to charter the plane.
""It's a cheeky opportunity to show Lewis some extra support as he steps into the lion's den here in Max's back yard,"" said fan Neil Steele.
""I hope a small way to get one up on the 70,000 Dutch fans that will surround and outnumber us few Lewis and Mercedes fans here at the track this weekend.""
(US$1 = 0.7236 pounds)

The seven-time world champion produced the fastest lap in a truncated morning session but lasted just three laps in the afternoon before his Mercedes ground to a halt with an engine problem on the Zandvoort circuit.
""Lewis reported a loss of power and was told to stop the car,"" Mercedes tweeted.
Hamilton's halt and subsequent return to the pits was greeted with cheers by the Dutch crowd, rooting for homeboy Max Verstappen who was fifth fastest.
After his half-points victory in the rain-reduced Belgian GP last weekend, the Red Bull driver is just three points behind Hamilton in the championship standings.
Leclerc clocked the fastest time of 1:10.902, which was 0.154 quicker than Ferrari teammate Carlos Sainz in second.
Alpine also had a good day as Esteban Ocon produced the third best time and Fernando Alonso the sixth.
Sandwiched between them were the Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas and Verstappen's Red Bull with Pierre Gasly (Alpha Tauri), Lando Norris (McLaren), Antonio Giovinazzi (Alfa Romeo) and Sebastian Vettel (Aston Martin). Hamilton was eleventh.
The afternoon provided some comfort for Vettel whose car came to a stop at the exit of the pit lane in the morning session, leaving a trail of oil behind it.
Vettel took a fire extinguisher from a marshall to put out a small fire but the car could not be touched as it was still electrically alive.
There was a lengthy delay before the car was covered in rubber sheets and then removed by the Aston Martin team.
That meant the hour-long session lost almost 40 minutes which limited the opportunities to stretch the cars fully on a challenging track that returns to the Grand Prix calendar for the first time since 1985.

The 2007 world champion, 41, who is retiring from Formula 1 at the end of the season, will be replaced in Zandvoort by Alfa Romeo's reserve driver Robert Kubica.
""Kimi is displaying no symptoms and is in good spirits. He has immediately entered isolation in his hotel. The team wishes Kimi a speedy recovery,"" the Alfa Romeo team tweeted.
Polish driver Kubica, 36, won the Canadian Grand Prix in 2008, but his career was severely hampered following a crash during the Andorra Rally in 2011 in which his right forearm was partially severed.
""Robert has been reserve driver ... since the start of the 2020 season and has driven the team's C41 in three practice sessions this year,"" Alfa Romeo said.
""With 97 Formula One starts to his name and experience with 2021 Formula One machinery, he will be ready for action and to give his best for the team.""

Williams said their team boss Jost Capito would also be absent from the paddock for the rest of the weekend as a precautionary measure, despite testing negative, after meeting the Finn on Friday.
Kubica, who last raced in Formula One at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in 2019 with Williams, joined the Swiss-based team in 2020  and has taken part in three free practice sessions so far this season.
""Kimi is displaying no symptoms and is in good spirits. He has immediately entered isolation in his hotel. The team wishes Kimi a speedy recovery,"" Alfa Romeo said in a statement.
Raikkonen's participation at next weekend's Italian Grand Prix at Monza, the fastest track on the calendar and a home race for Alfa, is also in doubt as the Finn cannot return to the paddock until he receives a negative test.
""First we check on Monday,"" team boss Frederic Vasseur told Sky Sports television. ""And we check with the local authorities in Italy but we are staying focused on this weekend first and then we'll see for Monza what we can do.""    
Raikkonen announced this week that he was retiring at the end of the season, 20 years after his Formula One debut.
At 41, the ""Iceman"" is the oldest driver on the starting grid and the 2007 world champion with Ferrari holds the all-time record for most race starts, at 341.
Kubica, 36, had stints with BMW Sauber and Renault from 2006 to 2010 and returned to the Formula One grid in 2019 after a near-fatal rally crash in 2011.
Sunday's race at Zandvoort is the first Dutch Grand Prix in 36 years and a new challenge for all on the F1 grid, with practice punctuated by red flags on Friday and overtaking expected to be difficult.
""I think he's ready,"" said Vasseur of Kubica, who was 19th of 20 drivers in final practice. ""It's probably not the easiest track to jump in on ... but it is like it is and we'll have to do the best job that we can.""
Alfa Romeo are ninth in the 10-team standings, 17 points behind Williams and three clear of bottom team Haas.

Verstappen had the 70,000-strong crowd, most of them wearing  orange or Red Bull shirts, roaring as he went top of the timing screens with a best time of one minute 09.623 seconds ahead of qualifying at Zandvoort.
Valtteri Bottas led team mate Lewis Hamilton as Mercedes filled second and third places respectively, 0.556 and 0.794 seconds slower.
""Max is in unbelievable form,"" commented 2016 world champion Nico Rosberg for Sky Sports television.
""That lap was just spectacular. He has so much confidence, he is flying out there. If everything goes normal, it's going to be difficult to catch him in qualifying today.""
The fans had earlier breathed a sigh of relief as stewards ruled out a possible grid penalty for the Red Bull driver who had been summoned for overtaking just as red flags were signalled on Friday.  
Red Bull's Mexican Sergio Perez was fourth fastest, with the battle again shaping up to be between the two title-chasing teams.
Hamilton leads Verstappen by three points ahead of Sunday's 13th race of the season, with the Dutch 23-year-old poised to retake the lead from the seven times world champion in the first Dutch Grand Prix for 36 years.
Sainz brought out the day's first red flags, after two interrupted sessions on Friday, when he lost the rear of the Ferrari and slammed sideways into the barriers at Hugenholtz, the third corner.
""Sorry guys. I don't know what happened,"" he said.
The Ferrari was craned off the track, leaving Sainz's mechanics with a race of their own to get the damaged car ready for qualifying.
Poland's Robert Kubica made an unexpected return to the track as a stand-in for Kimi Raikkonen at Alfa Romeo after the Finn tested positive for COVID-19.
Kubica, who last raced at the end of the 2019 season, was 19th of the 20 drivers with Italian team mate Antonio Giovinazzi 15th.

Even though Alfa Romeo driver Kimi Raikkonen had to pull out of the race after a positive COVID-19 test, fans on Saturday said the virus was the last thing on their minds.
""Once you get past the entrance, you just forget about it,"" a young woman who travelled 240 kilometres (150 miles) from the southern town of Maastricht to see local hero Max Verstappen said.
""It's just so good to be among so many people again. Let's hope it can set the example for other events to be allowed as well.""
The grand prix, the first in the Netherlands in 36 years, is the country's first mass event since the pandemic arrived, with music festivals and other cultural events still limited to tiny audiences to limit the spread of the disease.
This apparently uneven treatment has already sparked criticism in recent weeks, and images of thousands of people thronging the pathways at the race circuit fuelled the discontent on Friday, as many artists took to social media to express their anger.
But health minister Hugo de Jonge said no exceptions were made for the grand prix, as the event followed the rules for hosting a large crowd, meaning all spectators needed a negative COVID-19 test to get in and had to remain in their assigned seats as much as possible.
""But there is friction between the rules and the reality on the ground"", De Jonge said, commenting on the masses of people  who were clearly not in their seats.
""We can't avoid crowded situations. But we will manage the flow better and are asking people to remain in their seats longer"", Dutch GP spokesman Simon Keijzer said on Saturday.
This did not prevent big crowds forming again, however, as soon as the Formula One drivers left the track and fans went looking for food, drinks and toilets.
The rise of the Delta variant of the coronavirus has kept infections in the Netherlands relatively high in recent weeks, forcing the government to reinforce several social distancing measures last month.
It also limited the grand prix to two-thirds of its original capacity of 105,000 tickets for visitors per day.

Hamilton, three points clear in the standings after 12 races, was 0.038 seconds slower for Mercedes than Verstappen's best effort of one minute 08.885 seconds around the seaside circuit.
The Briton's team mate Valtteri Bottas qualified third with Frenchman Pierre Gasly fourth for Red Bull's sister team AlphaTauri.
The pole was the sixth in the last seven races for Verstappen, and the 10th of his career.
""It's an amazing feeling of course to get pole position here,"" said Verstappen as his Orange Army let off flares and celebrated.
""The crowd is incredible and today was also very enjoyable. The car was really nice to drive and this track in qualifying, once the fuel comes out, is really cool.""
Sunday's race will be the first Dutch Grand Prix in 36 years, the return driven by Verstappen's success and huge following.
""He did a fantastic lap and deserves the pole,"" said seven times world champion Hamilton, as some boos could be heard from the crowd.
Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz qualified fifth and sixth with Antonio Giovinazzi standing out in seventh for Alfa Romeo.
Alpine's Esteban Ocon and Fernando Alonso will line up eighth and ninth and Daniel Ricciardo qualified 10th for McLaren.
Williams drivers George Russell and Nicholas Latifi both crashed in the second phase of qualifying and brought out red flags.
Russell, who started on the front row at the previous race in Belgium last weekend after an astonishing qualifying lap, hit the barriers backwards but managed to keep the car running and returned to the pitlane with nearly four minutes remaining.
The Briton took no further part in qualifying and will start 11th, and when the track action re-started Latifi then lost control and smashed into the barriers in a much heavier impact.
""My tyres were going and I was pushing too hard,"" said Russell. ""I just attacked that corner too much and lost the rear. I'm sorry to the team.""
The second stoppage, with a minute and 38 seconds to go, meant McLaren's Lando Norris failed to get in a quick enough lap to go through to the top 10 shootout.
Verstappen's Mexican team mate Sergio Perez and Aston Martin's four times world champion Sebastian Vettel were the big casualties of the first phase.
Vettel, who will start in 17th place, was blocked by dawdling Haas drivers Nikita Mazepin and Mick Schumacher, and the three were summoned to see stewards after the session.
Mazepin blamed Schumacher in comments to Sky Sports television.
""He overtook, backed me up, and put me into Seb. I'll have a word with the team to see why that happened,"" said the Russian rookie.
Poland's Robert Kubica, standing in at short notice for 2007 world champion Kimi Raikkonen at Alfa Romeo after the Finn tested positive for COVID-19, qualified 18th and ahead of the Haas pair.","['633_0', '633_1', '633_2', '633_3', '633_4']","[""\n      Formula One F1 - Dutch Grand Prix - Circuit Zandvoort, Zandvoort, Netherlands - September 4, 2021 Red Bull's Max Verstappen poses with a tyre after qualifying in pole position Pool via REUTERS/Francisco Seco\n    "", ""\n      Formula One F1 - Dutch Grand Prix - Circuit Zandvoort, Zandvoort, Netherlands - September 4, 2021 Red Bull's Max Verstappen after qualifying in pole position REUTERS/Piroschka Van De Wouw\n    "", ""\n      Formula One F1 - Dutch Grand Prix - Circuit Zandvoort, Zandvoort, Netherlands - September 4, 2021 Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton during qualifying REUTERS/Piroschka Van De Wouw\n    "", ""\n      Formula One F1 - Dutch Grand Prix - Circuit Zandvoort, Zandvoort, Netherlands - September 4, 2021 Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton after qualifying in third position Pool via REUTERS/Francisco Seco\n    "", ""\n      Formula One F1 - Dutch Grand Prix - Circuit Zandvoort, Zandvoort, Netherlands - September 4, 2021 Fans celebrate as Red Bull's Max Verstappen qualifies in pole position REUTERS/Piroschka Van De Wouw\n    ""]"

Williams will need another driver if, as expected, young Briton George Russell moves to Mercedes next season alongside seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton.
""It's tricky to have a 100per cent Red Bull driver on a Mercedes power unit, so I'm happy to work with him as long as they let him free from his Red Bull contract,"" the Austrian told reporters at the Dutch Grand Prix when asked about Albon.
The 25-year-old Thai, dropped by Red Bull Racing at the end of last year but still under contract and now competing in the German Touring Cars (DTM), is a leading contender for the Williams seat.
Mercedes are also pushing their new Formula E champion Nyck de Vries, however, and Red Bull boss Christian Horner said on Friday he feared Mercedes would try and block Albon's move.
""Obviously there's a few hurdles. He (Albon) has had about four phone calls telling him not to go there from the team next door (Mercedes). I told him to ignore them,"" said Horner.
Wolff said Mercedes were backing de Vries but the Dutch driver was ""his own free agent"" in negotiations.
""Nyck is a Mercedes works driver in Formula E but I will never stand in Nyck's way to drive in Formula One,"" he said.
""We have no management contract with him, neither do we have an option of taking him back and therefore Nyck can drive in any team.""
Ferrari-powered Alfa Romeo have a vacancy with Kimi Raikkonen's retirement, although Valtteri Bottas is expected to move from Mercedes to take it.
The other slot at Alfa is currently occupied by Italian Antonio Giovinazzi, who qualified an impressive seventh at Zandvoort on Saturday.
Alfa team boss Fred Vasseur has indicated he would rather have an experienced driver than a complete rookie, with major rule changes coming next year.

A week after the farcical washout in Belgium, pole-sitter Verstappen controlled the race from the start in bright sunshine at a circuit set in coastal sand dunes at the beach resort of Zandvoort.
His seventh win in 13 races this season turned a three-point deficit into a three-point lead over seven-time world champion Hamilton ahead of Monza next weekend.
Hamilton came in second, setting the fastest lap on the final lap to earn a consolation bonus point, with Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas a distant third.
""As you can hear already, it's just incredible,"" said Verstappen, roared on by some 70,000 orange-clad fans at a venue where the last winner was Niki Lauda for McLaren 36 years ago.
""Expectations were high going into the weekend, I'm so happy to win here. It's such an amazing day, the whole crowd, incredible.""
Verstappen, who earned half points for his win over two laps behind the safety car at Spa last Sunday, pulled away on the opening lap here, keeping Hamilton in his rear-view mirror and surging clear.
""It's definitely a very good day. The start was very important, I think we did that well,"" said Verstappen.
""Of course, Mercedes tried to make it difficult for us but we countered them all the time really well. We can be pleased with the whole team performance today.""
A narrow track with punishing deep gravel traps made overtaking difficult, prompting Mercedes to use varying strategies for Hamilton and Bottas to ramp up the pressure on Verstappen.
Hamilton pitted on lap 21, inducing Red Bull to immediately call Verstappen in and leaving Bottas briefly at the head of the field.
Verstappen retook the lead as he burst past Bottas down the final straight on lap 31 to the sound of bellowing roars from the grandstand, but with the Finn having allowed Hamilton to eat away at the gap to the Dutchman.
- Verstappen delights home crowd -
Hamilton again came in on lap 40 to switch to medium tyres, needing to pick his way through traffic as he returned to the track.
A nerveless Verstappen continued to frustrate his title rival who feared his tyres wouldn't last to the finish.
As Verstappen cruised towards the line, igniting jubilant, orange smoke-filled celebrations along the North Sea coast, Hamilton entered the pits for the third time in a successful last-ditch attempt at the quickest lap.
On a day that began with Verstappen showing Dutch King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima around the Red Bull garage, Hamilton though simply had no answer to a regal display from the 23-year-old.
""Max did a great job, congratulations to him. I gave it everything, they were just too quick for us,"" said Hamilton, again frustrated in his bid to become the first man to win 100 Grands Prix.
""They had that upper edge, and it's very hard to follow here. The last lap was one of the best parts of the race for me - single lap, low fuel. This is now one of my favourite tracks.""
Pierre Gasly took fourth in his AlphaTauri ahead of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. Fernando Alonso made up three places on the grid to finish sixth followed by Carlos Sainz in the second Ferrari.

Verstappen lapped every driver except second placed Hamilton and the Briton's Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas as he powered to a dominant home win in front of 70,000 wildly celebrating fans.
The 23-year-old is now three points clear of seven-times world champion Hamilton, who gained a bonus point for fastest lap, after leading from pole position to chalk up a seventh win in 13 races.
""They just did a better job all round,"" said Hamilton, who has won four of the season's races but has been waiting for a career 100th since his home British Grand Prix in July.
""They definitely were faster today, there wasn't really a lot that I could do to answer to the lap times that he was putting in.
""I think today we probably needed everything to be perfect to have even the slightest chance of getting past him through strategy... they've taken a bit of a step ahead.""
Hamilton, the most successful Formula One driver of all time, faces a major challenge if he is to win an unprecedented eighth championship and he said the next race at Monza in Italy would be tough.
The Briton was critical of his team's strategy, Hamilton making his first pitstop before Verstappen at less than a third distance - a move that forced two stops and that he felt was called too soon.
""I definitely think that wasn't our best strategy,"" he said.
""We stopped too early ... it had just been a point where we got through traffic, I'd lost a good second from him and I needed to to close that gap up before we did a stop. And then I came out behind traffic.

The 23-year-old Red Bull driver triggered scenes in a 70,000-strong crowd already in full party mode after starting on pole position and taking the chequered flag with all but the two Mercedes drivers lapped.
The revival of the race at Zandvoort after a 36-year absence owed everything to Verstappen's surging popularity and success, the Dutchman the first championship contender the country has produced.
The man who started the hype rolling as Formula One's youngest ever driver (at 17) was already the youngest points scorer (17), podium finisher (18) and race winner (18).
On Sunday he joined a roster of greats that includes champions Juan Manuel Fangio, Jim Clark, Jack Brabham, Jackie Stewart, James Hunt, Niki Lauda and Alain Prost as winners in the Netherlands.
Organisers had said before the event that they could have sold a million tickets, far beyond capacity and COVID-19 restrictions, and those who did get in were there for a Verstappen victory.
No pressure, then.
""It is just incredible, because the expectations were very high going into the weekend and it's never easy to fulfil,"" he said after stepping out of the car, with the Dutch royal family in attendance.
""I've been always very focused,"" he explained later when asked how he had managed to stay calm amid the general madness.
""I know I have to focus on the driving and that has been quite straightforward but of course naturally there are more distractions, especially when you are on the grid or drive out and there’s more of a crowd.
""But I think we are professional enough to just focus on our job once we are in the car.""
Victory sent Verstappen three points clear of seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton in the standings and he will be hard to overhaul with nine rounds remaining.
""It's been a really positive week,"" he said, with some understatement, as fans continued to chant his name in the stands.
""I think they also know that I always do my best and you need a car to be able to win a race. We did, we had a very good car and we pulled it off as a team. It was a real team effort today.""
Verstappen said it had all been 'simply lovely', a catchphrase heard increasingly often from him as he adds to the pile of poles and wins.",['629_0'],"[""\nRed Bull's Max Verstappen celebrates on the podium after winning the race with Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton finishing second and Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas finishing third.

MERCEDES (Lewis Hamilton 2, Valtteri Bottas 3)
Hamilton lost the championship lead to Verstappen and is three points behind. He made three stops, the last for fresh tyres and to set fastest lap. Bottas tried a one-stop but pitted late in what the team said was a precaution and created a window for Hamilton to make his own final stop. The podium was the 175th of Hamilton's career. Bottas scored for the 125th time. Mercedes increased their lead in the constructors' standings.
RED BULL (Max Verstappen 1, Sergio Perez 8)
Verstappen's seventh win of the season came from pole position. He is the first Dutch winner of his home GP. Perez started from the pit lane after failing to make it through the first phase of qualifying and the team then changing components on the car. Perez was named Driver of the Day in a fan vote.
FERRARI (Charles Leclerc 5, Carlos Sainz 7)
Ferrari overtook McLaren for third place overall, now 11.5 points clear. Leclerc started fifth with Sainz sixth but the Spaniard failed to find the right balance and, on worn tyres, was overtaken by Alpine's Alonso on the penultimate lap.
MCLAREN (Lando Norris 10, Daniel Ricciardo 11)
Norris moved up from 13th on the grid to take a point, battling hard with Perez as the Mexican came back through the field. The pair made contact six laps from the end without consequences. Ricciardo had a clutch issue at the start and lost a position to Russell before reclaiming it. He and Norris changed places for strategic reasons.
ALPINE (Fernando Alonso 6, Esteban Ocon 9)
Another storming drive from Alonso, who started ninth and passed his team mate and Giovinazzi on the turn three banking and then took Sainz on the penultimate lap. Both did a one-stop strategy. Alpine stayed fifth but despite the double points finish lost ground to AlphaTauri.
ALPHATAURI (Pierre Gasly 4, Yuki Tsunoda retired)
Gasly is now eighth in the championship with his third double figures points haul of the season. He started fourth and had an uneventful race, lapped by Verstappen. Tsunoda retired with a power unit issue.
ASTON MARTIN (Lance Stroll 12, Sebastian Vettel 13)
Stroll did one stop and made a set of hards last 43 laps to the finish. Vettel did two stops. Both were compromised by qualifying 12th and 15th respectively on a track where overtaking is tricky.
WILLIAMS (Nicholas Latifi 16, George Russell 17)
Russell was classified 17th but retired the car on lap 70 with a suspected gearbox issue after starting 11th. He collected a five second time penalty for speeding in the pitlane. Both had crashed in qualifying and Latifi started in the pitlane after changing to a different front wing, passing both Haas cars.
ALFA ROMEO (Antonio Giovinazzi 14, Robert Kubica 15)
Kubica stood in for Kimi Raikkonen, who tested positive for COVID-19 before final practice. Giovinazzi started seventh but dropped places at the start after contact with Sainz and Alonso. The Italian then suffered a puncture after his scheduled pitstop and had to come in again. Kubica passed Latifi on the last lap.
HAAS (Mick Schumacher 18, Nikita Mazepin retired)

The pair clashed at the Dutch Grand Prix when Mazepin aggressively defended against Schumacher who was attempting to pass, with the two cars touching at the end of the opening lap.
Schumacher, who pitted for a new front wing, said he did not understand Mazepin's action.
""It just seems that he's got this thing in his head where he wants to by any cost be in front of me,"" Schumacher, son of Ferrari great Michael, told Sky Sports television.
""That's OK, I have nothing against it, but I think if we go to the point where we defend very aggressively against a team-mate where you don't have anything to gain then I think that is maybe not the right approach.""
Asked whether they could talk it through and resolve things, Schumacher replied: ""I don't think so, to be honest.""
The Haas cars are the slowest on the grid, with the drivers fighting only each other, but Schumacher said that was no excuse.
""It doesn't justify the fact that he pushes me into the wall, and basically pushes me to go into the pitlane,"" he said.
The pair were at loggerheads on Saturday when Mazepin claimed Schumacher had broken an agreement about who went first in qualifying.
Mazepin retired with an hydraulics issue and said he was upset not to finish.
Jenson Button, the retired 2009 world champion attending as a pundit for Sky, said the Russian had been too aggressive.
""It doesn't matter what happened yesterday, it shouldn't affect the way you drive today and if it does, you're in the wrong sport because this is a dangerous sport,"" said the Briton.
""If he wants any longevity in his career in F1, he needs to change his attitude because it's way too aggressive.

Hamilton has won the title for the past four years with Bottas playing the supporting role, finishing runner-up in the championship in 2019 and 2020.
The Briton said in a message on social media that he was proud to have worked with Bottas, who is expected to be replaced with 23-year-old Briton George Russell.
""He has been the best team mate I've had the pleasure of working with,"" Hamilton added.
""Your speed and resilience has been impressive but where you truly stand out to me is the human being you are,"" Hamilton told Bottas. ""You are greater than you know and I know there’s a bright future ahead for you.""
Hamilton's first team mate, at McLaren in 2007, was double world champion Fernando Alonso. They ended that season level on points with Hamilton ahead on placings and the Spaniard departing after a falling-out with the team.
Finland's Heikki Kovalainen, who only won once in his F1 career, joined him in 2008 and 2009 before then-reigning world champion Jenson Button arrived at McLaren in 2010.
Button finished ahead of his compatriot in the 2011 season.
Hamilton moved to Mercedes for the 2013 season to replace Michael Schumacher alongside Nico Rosberg, a boyhood friend and rival who beat him to the 2016 title as the relationship swiftly turned frosty.
Bottas replaced Rosberg when the German announced his shock retirement at the end of the 2016 season.
""You will be missed. I wish you all the best for your future endeavours,"" said Hamilton. ""Let’s finish off strong and get that eighth for the team.""

Gasly won last year's Italian Grand Prix at Monza, after starting 10th, and finished fourth on Sunday at Zandvoort in the first Dutch Grand Prix in 36 years.
The 25-year-old was a team mate to Dutch GP winner Max Verstappen in 2019 but was then demoted back to the junior team after 12 races.
He has gone from strength to strength at AlphaTauri, finishing second in Brazil in 2019 and third in Azerbaijan last June while Verstappen's subsequent team mates have also been eclipsed.
""Pierre is acquiring a growing fan club in F1 and I would count myself as a member,"" wrote Brawn in a column on the Formula One website.
""For him to come back from such a difficult blow after being dropped by Red Bull from their works team and return to win his first race and perform as consistently and strongly as he does with a car which won’t be as good as the works team is fantastic.
""It is a real credit to him that he’s stayed committed.
""Something will happen for him in the future. He won’t be able to stay in the family if an opportunity to return to the Red Bull works team isn’t coming. I think he’s too good for that. I think an opportunity will come at some stage.""
Gasly has scored 66 of AlphaTauri's 84 points this season, with Japanese rookie team mate Yuki Tsunoda some way off the Frenchman's pace.

French driver Gasly won the team's home Italian Grand Prix at Monza a year ago and finished fourth in the Netherlands last weekend. He also took a second in Brazil in 2019 and third in Azerbaijan last June. 
Honda-backed Japanese rookie Tsunoda scored points in his debut in Bahrain in March.
The team, which is based in Faenza, Italy, is the only one of the 10 on the grid to have scored points in every race this season, and said consistency and stability were essential heading into a year of major rule changes.
""This year we have seen that the positive relationship between the two, made of a competitiveness on track and a friendship off track, has proven effective for the team,"" said team boss Franz Tost in a statement.
The announcement means Red Bull's hope of bringing Thai racer Alexander Albon back to Formula One next season depends on him securing a seat outside the energy drink brand's own two teams, with talks ongoing at Williams and Alfa Romeo.
Gasly's confirmation had been certain with the Frenchman scoring 66 of the team's 84 points in 13 races so far this season.
Formula One's managing director Ross Brawn said on Monday that the Frenchman was too good to stay at AlphaTauri in the long term.
""I am very happy to be moving forward with Scuderia AlphaTauri for another season in Formula One, especially after seeing the progress that we’ve made as a team since I first joined in 2017,"" said Gasly.
""Seeing the performance we’ve shown so far this season, I think there are great things to achieve for the rest of this season and for next year...I really believe we can work well together to do even better in 2022.""
Tsunoda had only last week rated his chances of staying at 50-50.
The 21-year-old has scored in five races so far and is 13th in the championship.
""I’m so thankful to the team for letting me continue to grow my experience in Formula One with them,"" he said of an announcement that keeps him inside the Red Bull fold after the withdrawal of Honda at the end of this year.
The two Red Bull teams will continue to use engines assembled by Honda in Japan next year before Red Bull takes over production.

Russell is only 23, the same age as Red Bull's championship leader Max Verstappen and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, and with a similar talent that ultimately Mercedes could put on hold no longer.
In 50 races for Williams, he has out-qualified his team mate 50 times. He has put the eighth-ranked team on the front row of the grid and onto the podium, albeit with second place in a ""race"" without overtaking in Belgium.
""The past three seasons with Williams have given us a taste of what the future could hold for him in F1,"" said Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff of a driver 13 years younger than seven-times world champion Hamilton.
Fellow Briton Lando Norris, pushing hard in his third full season at McLaren, is 21 while Alpine's French driver Esteban Ocon is 24.
Verstappen, Leclerc and Ocon are grand prix winners - 17 times in the case of the Red Bull driver's meteoric rise - and it surely will not be long before Russell steps up to join them.
""It's certainly very positive,"" said Ferrari boss Mattia Binotto of what looks like a golden period ahead as the sport enters a new era with rule changes aimed at making racing closer.
""There are a lot of young drivers who are doing really very, very well...this may be the best time now for young drivers that we've had in F1.""
McLaren Racing's chief executive Zak Brown, speaking at last weekend's Dutch Grand Prix, said the sport was in a ""mega exciting"" place.
""All the big teams are going to have their young driver and I'm very bullish on Formula One's future, I'm excited for the new car, I think the cost cap is working,"" he added.
""Led by these superstar drivers with the big teams I think it's going to be massively exciting, the next decade of Formula One.""
Formula One still has three multiple world champions in Hamilton, Fernando Alonso and Sebastian Vettel but the future is here and hungry.
""It's so important to get yourself in a top team as a young driver early on, so you can show what you can do,"" said Britain's 1996 world champion Damon Hill on Sky Sports television.
The rise has been long-awaited, with Russell and Norris rivals in Formula Two in 2018 after Leclerc won the title in 2017, while Verstappen and Ocon competed against each other in European Formula Three.
""I remember meeting him when he was young, dreaming of one day being a Formula One driver,"" said Hamilton of Russell after the announcement.

Still the home race for Ferrari despite three other grands prix being held in Italy since last September's visit, Monza will host the sport's second Saturday Sprint after the concept debuted at Silverstone in July.
Qualifying is held on Friday for a short Saturday race that defines Sunday's grid and awards bonus points ahead of the 14th round of the championship.
Slipstreaming will come into play at a low-downforce power-sensitive circuit with cars at full throttle for most of the lap.
The title contenders could be level on points by Sunday, but with Red Bull's Verstappen ahead 7-4 on race wins, if Hamilton takes pole for Mercedes and his Dutch rival fails to qualify in the top three.
Hamilton took pole last year, setting Formula One's fastest ever lap on an all-Mercedes front row, with Verstappen only fifth fastest. 
The 23-year-old has yet to start on the front row at Monza but is on a roll, three points clear in the championship after winning his home Dutch race at Zandvoort last weekend and ready to complete a triple-header of triumphs.
""It hasn’t been our best track of the calendar the last few years but of course I know that this year we are competitive in general everywhere,"" said Verstappen, who has won five of the last seven races.
""We just need to nail the details and then I’m sure we can be competitive.""
Hamilton has not won a race on pure pace since Spain in May, his home victory at Silverstone coming after he and Verstappen clashed at the start, with the Red Bull driver crashing out. 
Verstappen had won the sprint element of that, gaining the three bonus points.
""We learned lessons on the new format at Silverstone and look forward to bringing that knowledge with us into this weekend,"" said Mercedes boss Toto Wolff, whose team have won five of the last seven at Monza but not the two most recent ones.
Last year's race was an anomaly, won by AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly after Hamilton was penalised for entering the pitlane while it was closed. Verstappen retired with a power unit problem after 30 laps.
""After the French Grand Prix this is very much a second home race for me now, because I live just 15km from the track,"" said Gasly.
""The weekend will be something new for me, returning to a race circuit where I was the last person to win the Grand Prix. I’m very keen to be there and there should be plenty of tifosi (fans), unlike last year.""
""I hope we can get another great result again this time.""
Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was the winner from pole at Monza in 2019 while the Monegasque's current team mate Carlos Sainz was second last year for McLaren.
The race at the park circuit outside Milan will have a 50per cent capacity crowd, after being run behind closed doors last time.
""This year might be a bit more difficult compared to 2019 but it will be good to feel the support,"" said Leclerc.

Raikkonen, the 2007 world champion with Ferrari, also missed last weekend's Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort and the Swiss-based team said in a statement on Wednesday that the 41-year-old had not yet been cleared to return.
""I hope he makes a full recovery and returns to the cockpit soon,"" said Kubica.
""I am looking forward to racing in Monza, an incredible track in which I claimed my first podium, in 2006. Unlike Zandvoort, it is a track I know well and this will help, particularly since the Sprint Qualifying weekend format means we will be one practice session short.
""I am happy with what I did in Holland and I can’t wait to help the team out one more time in Monza.""
Kubica finished 15th in that race, one place behind Italian team mate Antonio Giovinazzi.
The 36-year-old Pole raced for BMW Sauber and Renault from 2006 to 2010 and returned to the Formula One grid with Williams in 2019 after a near-fatal rally crash in 2011. Last weekend's race was his first since 2019.
This weekend will be the second time Formula One has experimented with a sprint format, a qualifying session on Friday and sprint race on Saturday to determine Sunday's starting grid.

617,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/motor-racing-imafidon-puts-hamiltons-diversity-push-practice-2167376,Motor racing: Imafidon puts Hamilton's diversity push into practice,"LONDON :     George Imafidon has gone from a boyhood passion for fixing bicycles in his mum's back garden to working with Lewis Hamilton and Sebastien Loeb, two of motorsport's greatest world champions.
His journey has taken him from Peckham, one of South London's most racially diverse areas, to the Saudi Arabian deserts, the Atlantic shores of Senegal and glaciers of Greenland.   
That is some success story for any 24-year-old but Imafidon stands out also for what he represents as well as what he has achieved. 
The Briton is the youngest member of a commission set up by seven-time Formula One world champion Hamilton to increase diversity in motorsport.
He is the only Black engineer in the all-electric off-road Extreme E series, where he supports nine times world rally champion Loeb and female Dakar racer Cristina Gutierrez at Hamilton's X44 team.
The gender equal series aims to raise awareness about climate change by racing in remote and harsh locations already suffering environmental damage.
""He (Hamilton) is constantly inspiring me to do more. it’s been amazing to learn from him,"" Imafidon, a co-founder of the Motivez app and social enterprise that connects young people to career opportunities, told Reuters. 
""It is very hands on in the sense that I get to see everything from end to end,"" he said of working with a small team at X44.
""I work with the drivers, I work with the data, the mechanics. I do everything from strategy, to the car and helping the mechanics actually get it up and running.""
BARRIERS
Imafidon, whose ultimate dream is to work in F1, embodies Hamilton's push for change and is an example of the sort of talent the sport has missed in the past.
While he stands out, he knows he is not alone.
""There are hundreds of Georges out there that are ambitious, resourceful and have had many different experiences that have given them the drive, but they don’t necessarily have as much access or they don’t feel they belong,"" he said.
""So they don’t decide to go in for these careers. Or when they do go for them, they’re not seen in the right ways in order to give them opportunity.
""It’s a pipeline issue more than anything.""
Imafidon, who got a first in engineering from London's prestigious UCL, applied to F1 teams while doing his degree.  Williams replied, others never did.
Among the barriers highlighted by the Hamilton Commission were teams limiting hiring to select universities and a feeling among Black students that motorsport was not for them because there was nobody there like them.
The report, led by the Royal Academy of Engineering, estimated only 1per cent of 40,000 people working in the UK motorsport sector was Black.
Imafidon, who joined a Formula Student team to build a race car at university, had no family background in motorsport or engineering but was mentored through school with assistance from the Amos Bursary, an organisation supporting youngsters of African and Caribbean heritage.
He said many young Black engineers had to temper ambition with realism.
""There’s not too many people who look like you who want to apply. Some people are not applying and in other areas someone like me is going for the opportunity and for some reason not getting in.""
That might be because teams want specialist qualifications, he said, while students from under-privileged backgrounds were loath to spend on getting them without any guarantee of a job.
""A lot of young people from under-represented groups feel like they need to do so many things, they need to add a lot of tools to their toolbox in order to thrive,"" he said. ""It’s a luxury to just focus on one thing.""
MORE ACCESSIBLE
Imafidon, who interned at Google and had a placement at Rolls Royce, said Black engineers often ended up going into other industries because they were more accessible.
That has changed, with a growing awareness across the sport that the problem needed to be fixed.
Formula One recently announced scholarships for 10 people from under-represented groups and Hamilton's Mercedes team have their own initiative.
""I think we’re at the beginning of everything,"" said Imafidon, who wanted his own example to become the norm rather than an exception.
""Until we achieve that goal I’m not going to stop,"" he said.
""I’m going to work at grassroots level, employer level, governance level to make sure we can change things because I think there’s so many more eight-year-old Georges out there that are just dying for an opportunity and they don’t see a pathway.
""If we can de-mystify that pathway, make it more accessible I think we’re on to something. I’m excited.""

Russell, 23, will be replacing Finland's Valtteri Bottas alongside the seven-times world champion and fellow Briton at the dominant team of the last seven years.
""George is coming in to learn from the team but he's got everything to gain. There's no real negative for him coming in the team. It's all a plus,"" Hamilton, 36, told reporters at the Italian Grand Prix in Monza.
Hamilton has a record 99 wins, 101 pole positions and a string of other records as the sport's most successful driver of all time.
If Russell prevails, it will put even more of a shine on the youngster's talents. If Hamilton wins out, it is only to be expected.
Ferrari's Charles Leclerc compared the situation to when he arrived at Maranello as a fresh, young team mate to four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel, then the main man at the Italian team, and eclipsed him.
""I think this is a pretty similar situation to mine when I arrived in Ferrari with Seb by my side,"" said the Monegasque, now the team's big hope for the future.
""It's a great position to be. George is very, very talented and he will be next to one of the best in the history of the sport.
""So he doesn't have much to lose, which is a good position to be in. He can just give it everything and show his talent and I'm pretty sure he will show the world his talent.""
Russell said it had been made clear to him by Mercedes that he would be on level terms with Hamilton, despite having only stood on the podium for the first time in a farcical Belgian Grand Prix last month.
Asked whether he felt he could beat Hamilton, Russell replied: ""Naturally, I believe in myself and I have high aspirations. But equally I know just how tough it's going to be.
""I'm in one of the most fortunate positions on the grid to be able to go out there and learn from him. I see this partnership with Mercedes as a long-term thing and I need to use next year as an opportunity to learn everything I can.

""We haven’t really decided yet where to take it,"" the Red Bull driver told reporters at Monza on Thursday when asked about a likely grid drop.
""This engine is still very new, so we'll see. It's definitely not the plan yet to take it here.""
The Dutch 23-year-old damaged one of his allotted three engines in a crash at Silverstone in July after colliding with Mercedes rival Lewis Hamilton and is expected to have to use a fourth before the end of the season.
That would bring an automatic 10-place drop.
High-speed Monza is generally a good place to take such a hit, with plenty of slipstreaming and overtaking, but Red Bull have struggled against Mercedes there in recent years.
This weekend is also being run to a new format with a Saturday sprint qualifying race that also brings bonus points for the top three.
Verstappen is three points clear of Hamilton after winning his home race at Zandvoort last weekend, his seventh victory in 13 races.
He said his car would be more competitive at Monza than previous years but warned that might not be enough at a track where Mercedes have won five of the last seven races, albeit not the most recent two.
""I'm not sure if it's going to be enough to fight them,"" said Verstappen.
""Nevertheless, this weekend with sprint qualifying and stuff, it's going to be very different so I just hope that, yeah, we did our homework before getting here and we can be very competitive. It's a bit difficult to say where we will stand

Albon, who lost his Red Bull Racing seat last year and has been that team's reserve, is part of a group of youngsters who have come up racing each other through the junior series and who remain close.
His return was confirmed by Williams on Wednesday ahead of the Italian Grand Prix.
""I'm very happy with Alex coming back into Formula One,"" championship-leading former team mate Max Verstappen told reporters.
""He's been my team mate, he's a great guy, he's a hard worker and he definitely deserves a spot in Formula One. He has a lot of talent so I'm also very sure he will come back strong and show good results.""
Mercedes-bound George Russell, whose place will be taken by Albon, endorsed the selection after pushing his friend's credentials.
""I definitely told the guys who I thought would be best suited,"" the Briton said when asked if he had recommended signing Albon.
""I think Alex's experience managed to tip the scales in his favour.
""Alex is a fantastic driver. He obviously had a tough time at Red Bull but I think he's going to come back even stronger. He's always been there in everything he's ever done and I'm sure the environment at Williams is going to suit him to a T.""
McLaren's Lando Norris, another old rival from Formula Two when Russell was champion in 2018, Norris the runner-up and Albon third, put out a picture on Twitter on Wednesday of the three of them together with the caption ""we're back"".
Alpine's 24-year-old French driver Esteban Ocon, who also had to take a year out of Formula One before securing his return, said it was fantastic news.
""He's one of the drivers that deserve that shot. I can imagine how tough that year must have been for him, being in that position,"" he said.
""He's been on the simulator and watching from the outside. It's painful, you have to be patient. I'm glad to see him back. I've been racing with him for a very long time and I can't wait to share more memories with him on the track.""",[],[]

The Italy-based outfit confirmed an unchanged lineup of Tsunoda and Frenchman Pierre Gasly, winner of last year's Italian Grand Prix, ahead of this weekend's home race at Monza.
Tsunoda, 21, had said last week that he rated his chances of staying at 50-50.
""From my side I was a bit surprised I'll be staying next year. So first of all, thanks for the team,"" the Honda-backed driver told reporters at Monza.
Asked why, he explained: ""Because I just keep crashing and cost the team a lot of money.
""I was not on a good way to end up the first half of the season, especially in Hungary when I went to the wall in FP1 (first practice) and ruined a whole session, almost two sessions.
""You need a more consistent result and more driving, and also discipline in the sessions. I couldn't improve through the first half of the season, and that's why.""
Tsunoda scored points on his debut in Bahrain in March and impressed many observers but he said some of that confidence had evaporated with the growing number of mistakes.
He said he would have to be more consistent next year.
""I didn't expect it to be that difficult in Formula One, because even in junior categories if I had a massive slap or went to the wall I never had this much losing confidence,"" he said.
""So that's one main issue. That's why I'm building up and trying to have more consistent laps, and consistent sessions.""

The sprint format is being experimented with at three rounds this season, for the second time in this weekend's Italian Grand Prix at Monza, with qualifying on Friday and a Saturday 100km race deciding the grid for Sunday.
Points are awarded for the top three drivers, in a 3-2-1 system.
One proposal under consideration is for pole to be awarded on Friday, instead of Saturday, with that qualifying session valid for both races.
""I think that will be probably the key issue, whether we make another step and make it stand-alone,"" Brawn told motorsport.com.
""I think that we'll have to look at the number of points awarded, and how do we determine the starting grid. So should it just be what was done on Friday?
""(Red Bull's Sergio) Perez dropped out at Silverstone (the first sprint) and then obviously his Sunday race was heavily compromised. So should we determine the starting order on Friday for both Saturday and Sunday?""
Brawn said the stand-alone idea had been suggested by a number of drivers.
He said there would be no mixing of formats, with the sprint kept as a means to determine Sunday's grid or as a stand-alone.
TOO SOON
Ferrari boss Mattia Binotto said it was still too soon to decide and suggested a reverse grid race on Saturday, with those leading the championship lining up at the back.
""I think that for the show and the spectacle, it can be of interest,"" he said.
""At the very start of the discussion of the mini race format, as Ferrari we were the ones proposing it.""
AlphaTauri boss Franz Tost said it was important not to undermine the main event.
""I think this new format is a good idea because we have now on Friday a highlight which is qualifying, on Saturday this sprint qualifying and on Sunday the race,"" said the Austrian.
""But of course we always must do everything that the highlight of the weekend must be the race on Sunday.""

The Finn, whose departure from the team at the end of the season was announced this week, did a one minute 19.555 second lap with seven times world champion Hamilton 0.096 slower and championship leader Max Verstappen third for Red Bull.
""Oh yes. Boom! Thanks,"" Bottas said over the team radio after the lap catapulted him from fifth to first at the fastest circuit on the calendar.
He will start from the back of the grid on Sunday after a strategic power unit change triggered a penalty for exceeding the allocation of three for the season, but can still score on Saturday.
Three points go to the sprint winner, who will take pole position for Sunday's main event. Two go to the second-placed driver and one for the third with any grid penalties not applied until afterwards.
""That qualifying lap was nice,"" said Bottas, who will be moving to Alfa Romeo to replace retiring compatriot Kimi Raikkonen.
""It feels so good when you get a nice lap. I managed to save it to the end and had a bit of a (aerodynamic) tow as well so it was good fun. I enjoyed it.
""I feel good, I feel relaxed and everything is sorted for the future. Really pleased with the team today, the car has been  so good,"" he added.
Hamilton is three points behind Verstappen after 13 races and is set to cut the gap to the Dutchman in Saturday's 100km dash.
""Congratulations to Valtteri, he did a mega lap,"" said Hamilton. ""It was looking good for us until the end but then he went quicker, and I just couldn't match it.""
Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff indicated that Bottas would be told to swap places with Hamilton on Saturday if running one-two and comfortably clear of Verstappen.
""Presumably, yes,"" the Austrian told Sky Sports television.
""It's difficult generally when you have to call team orders because all of us as racers we don't want to see that... but Valtteri's going all the way to the back on Sunday.""
SPRINT FORMAT
The hour-long qualifying at the 'Temple of Speed' outside Milan replaced Friday's usual second practice, with the sprint format being trialled for the second time after a debut at Silverstone in July. 
Verstappen was 0.411 slower than Bottas and Mercedes seem to have the edge again at a circuit where they have won five times in the last seven years.
""I think for us around this track it's always going to be difficult,"" said Verstappen. ""We struggled a little more than we wanted in the free practice but I think we recovered quite well throughout this qualifying.
""For the race hopefully we can be a bit closer.""
McLaren's Lando Norris and Daniel Ricciardo will line up fourth and fifth with AlphaTauri's 2020 winner Pierre Gasly sixth and Ferrari's Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc seventh and eighth.
Red Bull's Mexican Sergio Perez qualified ninth, but gave Verstappen a vital tow to his own cost. Alfa Romeo's Antonio Giovinazzi, whose place for 2022 looks uncertain, completed the top 10.
The session saw cars backing each other up and there was a near-miss in the pitlane when Hamilton and Aston Martin's Sebastian Vettel almost collided.
Aston Martin and Alpine mechanics were fortunate not to have been hit and both teams were fined 5,000 euros (US$5,906.50).
Stewards said Aston had released their cars at the same time, with Vettel moving aside and forcing Hamilton to take avoiding action. 
The Alpine mechanic responsible for releasing Esteban Ocon also put himself in a dangerous situation, they added.

Hamilton's Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas won the 18 lap race around the fastest track on the calendar but engine penalties sent the Finn to the back of the grid for Sunday's main event at Monza.
While Verstappen is perfectly placed for an eighth win in 14 races, seven-times world champion Hamilton will start fourth and with the championship gap in danger of dropping into double figures.
""The race was better than expected, we scored some nice little points. It is going to be an interesting race tomorrow,"" said Verstappen, second at the chequered flag.
""I don't expect it to be a very straightforward and easy race because of Valtteri coming from the back and Lewis starting in P4 with a lot of pace. We'll see what we can do against them.""
McLaren's Australian Daniel Ricciardo will join the Dutch 23-year-old on the front row for the first time since Mexico 2018 when the pair were team mates at Red Bull.
Bottas took three championship points, Verstappen two and Ricciardo one in an experimental race format being trialled for only the second time after a debut at Silverstone in July.
""It was a good sprint. Everything went smoothly, I had a really good start and the car was really consistent,"" said Bottas.
""It's been a perfect weekend and then I have the grid penalty. That happens. Anything is possible (on Sunday). You never know. I'll keep pushing.""
Champions Mercedes had planned to impose team orders for their drivers to swap places during the race and maximise Hamilton's points haul but that opportunity never materialised.
Hamilton dropped four places at the start and only reclaimed one when AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly, last year's surprise winner at the Italian team's home race, hit the back of Ricciardo's McLaren at the first chicane and crashed out.
That brought out the safety car until the end of lap three and Hamilton was unable to get close enough to Norris after that to attempt an overtake.
""It wasn't great,"" the Briton said of his afternoon.
""I've got to try and figure out how I can get by and try to limit the damage.

Italian Antonio Giovinazzi lines up seventh for Alfa Romeo, with Red Bull's Mexican Sergio Perez alongside and Aston Martin's Lance Stroll ninth. Alpine's Fernando Alonso secured the 10th slot.
Japanese rookie Yuki Tsunoda and Alfa Romeo's Robert Kubica also tangled at the start.
Ricciardo, who has had a tough time since his move to McLaren from Renault at the end of last year, was delighted to be back at the front of the grid with McLaren using the soft tyres when most others opted for mediums.
""It's been a while since a front row,"" he said. ""I guess thanks to Valtteri for that.
""It's cool. First time up here in the sprint as well. We've got the big one tomorrow but I think I've done the job today, ticked the box to get me in a better starting spot ...

Mercedes' seven-times world champion has not won since his record-extending 99th victory in his home British Grand Prix at Silverstone on Jul 18.
With Red Bull's championship leader Max Verstappen qualifying on pole on Saturday and two Mercedes-powered McLarens ahead of him, Hamilton was not putting much positive spin on the situation.
Silverstone marked the debut of the experimental sprint qualifying format and Monza was the second trial of it but Hamilton struggled at the start.
He dropped four places from second to sixth, recouping one when AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly crashed and another because team mate Valtteri Bottas, the sprint winner, starts Sunday's race from the back due to engine penalties.
""I was being as aggressive as I could be,"" he said of his afternoon. ""The McLarens are the quickest on the straights, I just couldn't get close enough to then capitalise on the straight line.
""They were just as fast in straights, if not faster.
""The start was just ... broke away traction. Subtle. Like two millimetres too deep with the clutch pedal and wheelspin. That's it.""
Asked whether there might be 'some sort of curse' on getting to his 100th, Hamilton said he was not a believer in such things.
""Tomorrow is highly unlikely but not impossible that we can get the win. I'll of course be working as hard as I can to try. I think it's damage limitation at the moment.
""It generally should be a relatively easy race for Max unless I can get past the two McLarens early on and then challenge him.""
Verstappen's second place finish in the sprint meant he secured two championship points, sending the Dutch 23-year-old five points clear of Hamilton with every chance of taking the lead into double figures on Sunday.",['608_0'],"[""\nMercedes' Lewis Hamilton before the sprint qualifying.

The 100km qualifying race was trialled for the second time at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, but drivers struggled to overtake.
Mercedes' seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton made a poor start and ended up fourth on the grid for Sunday's main race, with title rival Max Verstappen putting his Red Bull on pole.
Valtteri Bottas won the sprint for Mercedes, leading all the way, but the Finn will start last on Sunday due to engine penalties.
Ferrari boss Mattia Binotto has suggested reverse grids could be used next season while Formula One is also considering running sprint races as stand-alone events unrelated to Sunday's grand prix.
Asked for his opinion, Wolff told reporters he felt the experiments were 'diluting the DNA of the sport as a meritocracy.
""I think the sprint races was worth the try, not sure we will keep them,"" he added. 
""Reverse grids can be done in junior formulas where you want to see the overtaking abilities of drivers but its not something we should even come close to in Formula One.""
Wolff said his preference would be to reduce the amount of practice time.
""Start Friday afternoon with FP1 (first practice), do a Saturday morning FP2, do a conventional qualifying like we do and a fantastic grand prix on Sunday,"" he said.
""And maybe you want to do some warm-up on Sunday morning, to have a little bit more spectacle for the people. I would just shorten the free practice sessions so there is more variability in the results, keep the rest like it is.""
The Austrian said everybody was confused with the sprint format and it ""doesn't give a lot of benefit"" because nobody was prepared to take a serious risk.
Formula One has scheduled a third sprint for Brazil in November and Wolff agreed the sport should give it another try and see if anything changed.
Formula One managing director for motorsport Ross Brawn said it had been a ""little bit quiet"" at the front of the field but that happened in races anyway and the potential was evident.
""I think it's added to the whole weekend,"" he said.
The Briton said drivers had been generally positive but some felt there should be more reward for the sprint and also more jeopardy.
""If we're doing that, then maybe a stand-alone event is a consideration. Qualifying on a Friday, race on a Sunday but a stand-alone event with some decent reward but maybe a little bit of jeopardy in the grid and how you start it,"" he said.
""We don't want gimmicks, we don't want to cannibalise, we don't want to affect the integrity.""
Brawn said there had been much more engagement with fans on a Friday.

606,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/motor-racing-mercedes-see-engine-compromise-help-vw-enter-formula-one-2172526,Motor racing: Mercedes see engine compromise to help VW enter Formula One,":Mercedes are open to compromise on Formula One's future engine rules to make it easier for the Volkswagen Group to enter the sport, motorsport head and F1 team boss Toto Wolff told reporters at the Italian Grand Prix.
The sport is due to introduce a new engine formula from 2025 and manufacturers are discussing how to make power units simpler, cheaper and more sustainable.
The Volkswagen Group, whose brands include Porsche and Audi, has attended engine manufacturer meetings as an interested party with the latest held on Sunday.
Wolff said Mercedes would be willing to get rid of the MGU-H (Motor Generator Unit-Heat) element, with the new rules possibly delayed to 2026.
The current V6 turbo hybrid power units have two Motor Generator Units, the other being the MGU-K that recovers and supplies kinetic energy from braking. The MGU-H recovers and stores energy from or to the turbocharger.
""The MGU-H is going to be dropped if we can find alignment of many other points,"" said Wolff.
""I think it's a compromise. I cannot speak for anybody else but at Mercedes we are prepared to...in order to facilitate the entry of the Volkswagen Group.
""But there are several other topics where compromise needs to be found,"" he added.
""If compromise cannot be found then we will probably revert to the governance and have 2026 regulations that the (governing) FIA and FOM (Formula One Management) are going to come up with.""
Formula One said in a statement that Sunday's meeting involved existing and prospective power unit suppliers as well as the FIA and Formula One.
""The discussion was positive and progress was made,"" it said. Some details remain to be addressed, however, we expect these to be resolved in the coming weeks.""  
The sport is hoping to attract more engine manufacturers with Honda pulling out at the end of this season and Red Bull taking over the Japanese manufacturer's intellectual property.
Red Bull are keen to simplify the engines and cut out the MGU-H element.
Champions Mercedes supply four of the 10 teams at present and Ferrari three, with Renault providing engines to their own Alpine-branded team. Honda work with Red Bull and sister team AlphaTauri. 
Red Bull have worked with the Volkswagen Group in the past, notably in the world rally championship before the German manufacturer withdrew, and there has long been talk of a partnership with Audi or Porsche in Formula One.
Former Volkswagen Motorsport head Jost Capito is now boss of the Mercedes-powered Williams team, who last week announced Red Bull-backed Alex Albon would be racing for them next season.
Formula One's chief executive Stefano Domenicali was previously head of Italian sportscar marque Lamborghini, a subsidiary of Audi, while Renault CEO Luca di Meo joined the French manufacturer from VW brand Seat after a stint at Audi.

Russell, 23, is moving on and up to Mercedes next season as team mate to seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton and his support for the Red Bull-backed Thai as his replacement for 2022 was evident.
Williams have struggled since 2018, scoring only one point in 2019 and none in 2020, but are now eighth out of 10 after Russell finished second in a rain-hit and farcical Belgian Grand Prix and Nicholas Latifi was ninth.
They also scored points with both drivers in Hungary in August.
""With Williams, they are clearly a team on the up, with the investment they have,"" Albon told reporters at the Italian Grand Prix where he is carrying out duties as Red Bull reserve.
""I had the chance to visit the team and they all seemed very positive, optimistic. They were very keen to talk to me and get involved in making things happen. It seemed like a great choice to get back onto the grid.""
Williams changed ownership last year with the founding family departing and U.S.-based Dorilton capital taking over.
The team use Mercedes engines, which was an initial sticking point in talks with Albon given his close ties to Red Bull but the contract has safeguards in place to protect the German manufacturer's intellectual property.
""He is basically a Williams driver for the next 12 months. He has no links to Red Bull during that time,"" said Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff.
Albon has also been racing in the German Touring Car championship (DTM) this season after being dropped by Red Bull's main Formula One team to make way for Mexican Sergio Perez alongside now-championship leader Max Verstappen.
He said it had been ""a tricky year"" and watching from the sidelines never fun.
The Thai also revealed he looked closely at the U.S.-based IndyCar series, travelling to Indianapolis, and the all-electric Formula E championship as fallback options if Formula One talks fell through.   
A friend and rival of Russell and McLaren's Lando Norris through the junior series before they all broke into Formula One together, Albon said he was ""thankful and excited"" to be back. 
""I'm close with George. Of course I knew more or less the landscape of where drivers were heading,"" he said.
""He was very supportive. I'd almost say too supportive because I remember the (Williams) board guys saying 'We can't really take George's opinion because he's so supportive of you'. I owe him a couple of beers.""

Stewards handed Red Bull's championship leader Verstappen a three place grid penalty for the next round in Russia after his car landed on top of Hamilton's Mercedes, with the rear tyre hitting the champion's head.
The halo protection device, a titanium ring around the cockpit, took most of the impact in a crash that left both drivers out of the race at Monza.
""I feel very, very fortunate today thank God for the halo. That did ultimately save me, you know, and saved my neck,"" seven times world champion Hamilton told reporters.
""I don't think I've ever been hit on the head by a car before, and it's quite a shock for me.
""I'm so, so grateful that I'm still here. I feel incredibly blessed. I feel like someone was watching over me today.""
Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff called a 'tactical foul' but Red Bull counterpart Christian Horner said he was disappointed by the Austrian's comment.
""I think it's a racing incident and thankfully nobody was injured today,"" he said after a race that ended in a McLaren one-two with Australian Daniel Ricciardo the winner.
Stewards disagreed and said Hamilton's positioning was reasonable.
Verstappen started and ended the day five points clear of Hamilton after gaining two points from Saturday's sprint qualifying race.
The Red Bull driver had lost 11 seconds to a slow pitstop that dropped him down the order and when Hamilton pitted later the Briton emerged from the pitlane a fraction ahead.
The cars ran wheel-to-wheel and made contact at the first chicane, the Red Bull lifting off the kerb and into the air with both ending up in the gravel.
""I made sure I left a car's width on the outside for him, I went into turn one and I was ahead and going into turn two and then all of a sudden he was on top of me,"" said Hamilton.
""He just didn't want to give way today and he knew when he was going into two what was going to happen... but he still did it,"" he told Sky Sports television.
Verstappen said Hamilton ""just kept on squeezing me.
""If he would have left me just a car width we would have raced out of turn two anyway and I think he would have probably still been in front. But he just kept on pushing me wider and at one point there was nowhere to go.""
The title rivals also collided at Hamilton's own British Grand Prix when Verstappen ended up in hospital for checks and Hamilton took the win.
""It was clear for Max that it would end up in a crash,"" said Wolff.
""We had a high-speed crash in Silverstone. We had one car ending up on top of the other one, on Lewis's head, here. So how far can we go? Maybe next time we have a high-speed crash and land on each other.""","['604_0', '604_1', '604_2', '604_3', '604_4']","[""\n      Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton after crashing out of the race with Red Bull's Max Verstappen.

The victory was McLaren's first since 2012, the last being Jenson Button's victory in Brazil in November of that year, and Ricciardo's first since he was at Red Bull in 2018.
""About time,"" smiled the happy Australian before performing his trademark 'Shoey' - glugging the podium champagne from his sweaty boot and sharing it with second-placed team mate Lando Norris and McLaren boss Zak Brown.
""To lead literally from start to finish, I don't think any of us expected that,"" he said.
""To not only win but to get a one-two, it's insane. For McLaren to be on the podium is huge.""
Ricciardo, whose other seven wins were all with Red Bull, had started on the front row and seized the lead from Verstappen at the start and he completed his day with a bonus point for fastest lap and voted Driver of the Day by fans.
The result, on pace and merit, was a perfect reply from the Australian to his critics after struggling to get to grips with the McLaren since joining from Renault at the end of last year.
""For anyone who thought I'd left, I never left,"" he said over the radio after taking the chequered flag. ""I just moved aside for a while.""
Valtteri Bottas took third for Mercedes after winning the Saturday sprint race and then starting at the back of the grid due to engine penalties.
The Finn finished fourth on track but Red Bull's Sergio Perez ahead of him had a five second penalty that dropped the Mexican down to fifth with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc fourth.
While McLaren celebrated, Verstappen and Hamilton had nothing to smile about.
The pair collided and crashed out after their pitstops, with Verstappen's Red Bull lifting off the kerb and ending up on top of Hamilton's Mercedes in the gravel, with the halo head protection device keeping the champion out of harm's way.
Both climbed out after the accident at the first chicane, with Verstappen's five-point lead in the championship unchanged.
""That's what happens when you don't give space,"" said Verstappen on the team radio of what could be a defining image of the season and evoked memories of the famous late 1980s clashes between the late Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost.
""It (the car) landed on my head, but I'll be OK,"" said a sore Hamilton.
""I was racing as hard as I could, finally got past Lando and was in the lead so they pitted me. The pitstop was slow, I lost a couple of seconds and I came out. Daniel came past, Max was coming.
""I made sure I left a car's width on the outside for him, I went into turn one and I was ahead and going into turn two and then all of a sudden he was on top of me.
""He just didn't want to give way today and he knew when he was going into two what was going to happen...but he still did it,"" the Briton told Sky Sports television.
The pair have collided before this season, notably at Hamilton's own British Grand Prix, and Sunday's latest clash will keep fans talking for some time.
Ferrari's Carlos Sainz was sixth with Lance Stroll seventh for Aston Martin and Fernando Alonso eighth for Renault-owned Alpine.
George Russell, Hamilton's team mate next year, took two points for Williams in ninth with Esteban Ocon 10th for Alpine.

MERCEDES (Valtteri Bottas 3, Lewis Hamilton retired)
Bottas won the Saturday sprint but started 19th and last after engine penalties. He finished fourth on track but moved up due to Perez taking a time penalty. Hamilton and Verstappen collided on lap 26 of 53, both retiring on the spot.
It was Hamilton's first non-finish of the season and first retirement since July 2018. Verstappen's car landed on the Mercedes but the halo took the impact, saving Hamilton from serious injury. The crash triggered a safety car period.
Mercedes extended their constructors' lead to 18 points. Hamilton is five behind Verstappen.
RED BULL (Sergio Perez 5, Max Verstappen retired)
Verstappen collected a three place grid penalty for the next race in Russia for causing the collision with Hamilton. Perez was third on track but dropped after a five second penalty for gaining an advantage by exceeding track limits.
MCLAREN (Daniel Ricciardo 1, Lando Norris 2)
McLaren's first win since 2012 and Ricciardo's first since he was at Red Bull in 2018. He started second and grabbed the lead into the first corner. They are the only team to have finished one-two this season. Their last previous one-two was in Canada in 2010. Second was a career best for Norris.
FERRARI (Charles Leclerc 4, Carlos Sainz 6)
Leclerc, winner in 2019 at Monza, gained a place after Perez's penalty but the car lacked speed on the straights. Sainz, second last year for McLaren, was appearing for the first time at Monza in Ferrari colours. The Spaniard struggled with the rear of the car sliding around.
ALPINE (Fernando Alonso 8, Esteban Ocon 10)
Alpine stay fifth but have now scored in 13 races in a row. Ocon had to give a place back to Latifi early on and collected a five second penalty for a collision with Vettel on lap 15, serving it during his pitstop. Alonso had a lonely race.
ALPHATAURI (Pierre Gasly retired, Yuki Tsunoda no start)
Gasly, last year's surprise winner, retired early on with an unspecified systems problem while Tsunoda was wheeled off the grid and did not start due to a brake issue. AlphaTauri's record as the only team to score in every race this year ended.
ASTON MARTIN (Lance Stroll 7, Sebastian Vettel 12)

Russell, starting 14th, scored points for the third time in four races, with Williams now 19 clear of Alfa. Russell gained positions in the pitlane thanks to the safety car. Latifi was unlucky with the timing of the safety car.

598,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/rugby-springboks-reality-check-wallabies-beat-them-their-own-game-2174226,Rugby: Springboks' reality check as Wallabies beat them at their own game,"MELBOURNE :     Winning has been South Africa's most effective riposte to accusations of playing a boring brand of rugby but that defence was taken away on Sunday by an Australian team with a similar game plan.
After two easy wins over Argentina, the world champions were stunned 28-26 by the Wallabies on the Gold Coast despite welcoming back key reinforcements in number eight Duane Vermeulen and scrumhalf Faf de Klerk from injury.
Apart from the personnel changes, the Springboks' brain trust had seen little need to depart from the trusted formula of power and set piece dominance that underpinned their 2-1 series victory over the British and Irish Lions.
They may be thinking differently now after the Wallabies unlocked their no-frills game with a similar determination to not run the ball.
True to form, the Springboks scored all three of their tries from lineout drives while never really threatening to create one through backline inspiration.
The Wallabies needed only a single try - and 23 points off the tee from recalled flyhalf Quade Cooper - to bring the Boks back to earth.
All Blacks staff were unable to watch the game as they hastened to leave Robina Stadium after their 39-0 win over Argentina in the first match of the test double-header.
But they will no doubt take interest in the Wallabies' blueprint for victory when they sit down to watch the video ahead of back-to-back matches against the Springboks.
South Africa coach Jacques Nienaber will hope to have key attacking weapon Cheslin Kolbe back after he injured his leg in training last week.
They will also look to flyhalf Handre Pollard to kick straighter in the Australia re-match in Brisbane on Saturday after he left valuable points on the field on the Gold Coast.
That may be enough to fend off another siege from the dogged Wallabies but might not be sufficient to stop the rampaging All Blacks in their tracks in two weeks' time.

McLaren Racing boss Zak Brown, who has the original number three Wrangler-liveried coupe in his collection, promised Ricciardo back in March a test in the car if he stood on the podium this season.
""I’m like, maybe he gives me the car?,"" the Australian, who also races with the number three on his McLaren, said hopefully after a one-two finish with team mate Lando Norris at Monza on Sunday.
""It was always 'a podium, I get to drive it'. We never talked about a win.
""I gave him my shoe that he drank out of, so maybe he gives me the car. It’s a good trade.""
Ricciardo's win was McLaren's first since Jenson Button in Brazil in November 2012, a wait of 3,213 days. 
It was also their first one-two since 2010.
For the second most successful team in the history of Formula One, second only to Ferrari, who have been around since the very beginning in 1950, in terms of wins and total championships, Sunday was both a beginning and an end.
The end of a long agony of constantly being reminded of their absence from the top step of the podium, a drought matched by that of former champions Williams, but also the start of a return to winning ways.
Ricciardo, who had not won since he was at Red Bull in 2018 and has had a tough time getting to grips with the car since leaving Renault at the end of last year, eloquently summed up what it meant to him.
""There’s like a couple of things today, like two heroes,"" he said.
""Dale Earnhardt, big hero of mine, and to have a chance to get behind the wheel of one of his cars is crazy. That will certainly be a 'pinch me' moment. 
""The other one ... I’m sorry if I sound a bit self-absorbed now, but when I think of McLaren I think of (the late triple champion Ayrton) Senna.
""That’s the early memories and I’ve seen the trophies in the cabinet at the MTC (factory) and to have a winning trophy now with my name in pretty much the same cabinet is crazy.""
Brown, up on the podium with his drivers to celebrate and swig champagne with surprising gusto from Ricciardo's sweaty boot, enjoyed the moment.
The American was also mindful of there being a long road ahead for McLaren to get back to where they really want to be.
""One win, and last weekend wasn't very good,"" said the American. ""So I think we've got to keep our feet on the ground. One win at a time.""

The Australian said that although the collision was relatively low-speed, the FIA's safety experts would still take a look.
The crash had Verstappen's Red Bull lift up off a kerb and land on Hamilton's Mercedes with the inside of a rear wheel hitting the seven-times world champion's helmet through the protective halo.
""Incidents that are different, so it's not necessarily high G impacts or anything like that, but are unusual, we do look at,"" said Masi.
""Our safety department does look at them in detail, investigate and see what we can learn and what we can improve for the future. That's how we have a whole lot of the safety features that we have today, and will continue to evolve into the future.
""We are already collecting all of the data, so we have all of the information and that will all go to our safety department together with any photographs and anything else we have along the way."" 
The Monza stewards blamed championship leader Verstappen and handed the Dutch 23-year-old a three place grid drop for the next race in Russia.
Hamilton said it had been a shock to be hit on the head and  the titanium ring had saved his life.
""I'm so, so grateful that I'm still here. I feel incredibly blessed. I feel like someone was watching over me today,"" said the Briton. 
Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said the halo had saved Hamilton's life and Red Bull boss Christian Horner agreed the device, made mandatory in 2018 to considerable opposition from some drivers, had done its job.
""It was a very awkward accident and you could see Max's car ride up the Mercedes and I think without the halo there would've been no protection for the weight of that wheel coming down on top of Lewis,"" said Horner.
""I think the halo has again demonstrated its purpose in Formula One.""
FIA president Jean Todt posted on Twitter a photograph of the Red Bull on top of the Mercedes with the comment ""Glad the halo was there"".
Several F1 drivers have credited the device for saving their lives, including Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and former Haas racer Romain Grosjean.
""I wasn't for the halo some years ago but I think it's the greatest thing that we brought to Formula One,"" he said after the device shielded his head when his car penetrated the barriers in fiery crash in Bahrain last year.

Italian Grand Prix Stewards deemed Red Bull's championship leader Verstappen was at fault for Sunday's collision and handed the Dutch youngster a three-place grid penalty for the next race in Russia.
Brawn, a former Honda and Mercedes team boss and ex-Ferrari technical head, said fans were sure to be split on who was to blame.
""It’s clear both drivers could have avoided it,"" he said in his regular post-race column on the official http://www.formula1.com website.
""Ultimately, I think it’s another consequence of two guys going head to head and not wanting to give an inch.
""Personally, I wouldn’t say it has changed the dynamic. You’ve got two cockerels in the farmyard at the moment and we are seeing the consequence of it.
""I don’t think either will back off at any moment for the rest of the year but I hope the championship is won on the track not in the barriers or the stewards' room.""
Sunday was the second big clash between the two in the space of five races after earlier wheel-to-wheel incidents.
At the British Grand Prix in July, Verstappen crashed at speed and ended up in hospital for checks while Hamilton went on to win in front of his home fans.
That race, like Monza, followed an experimental Saturday sprint qualifying race and Brawn saw ""plenty of positives"".
""It shook up the order and led to a slightly evolved grid, which in turn created a different dynamic in the race,"" he said.

The Canadian billionaire told reporters the Silverstone factory and 'campus' would cost £150-200 million (US$207 to US$276 million) and be the most sustainable in Formula One.
The facility over the road from the British Grand Prix circuit is expected to be completed by late 2022 or early 2023 with room for 1,000 people.
McLaren's Norman Foster-designed headquarters at Woking, which opened in 2004, is the most recent new F1 factory to be built in Britain but Stroll said his would be very different to that.
""It will be the only one perfectly fit for purpose with the financial regulations (cost cap) taken into consideration,"" said Stroll, whose son Lance drives for the team.
""It shows my belief in the team, it confirms my ambitions and it confirms my belief in Formula One, because this is really an investment as well in Formula One.
""This is a building that will truly represent our image, our culture and our DNA.""
Formula One is considering banning wind tunnels for aerodynamic development and testing but Stroll doubted that would happen and said that even if it did, it would not be before 2030.
""We believe it's a worthy investment that will have seven to eight years to be able to use it before any decision is made. I personally don't think wind tunnels will disappear,"" he said.

Aston Martin said earlier on Tuesday that they had started building their new F1 factory at Silverstone.
Vettel, who won his titles with Red Bull from 2010-13, joined the team from Ferrari at the end of last year and the German turned 34 in July.
Vettel is 12th in the championship after 14 races, with Stroll's son Lance a place behind.
The German took second place in Azerbaijan and was disqualified from second in Hungary after his car had insufficient fuel remaining after the race. 
He has also been increasingly outspoken on environmental issues and climate change.
Stroll said Vettel's personal views had ""no bearing whatsoever on our strong and ongoing desire for him to continue to drive for us in Formula One"".

Audi and BMW left Formula E last season and champions Mercedes, who supply powertrains to Monaco-based Venturi, are departing at the end of the next one.
Di Grassi told reporters he had considered taking a year out until the Venturi opportunity came along.
""Regarding the decisions of Audi, BMW and Mercedes to leave the championship, I think other manufacturers will join in the future,"" he said.
""Formula E with Gen3 (the new cars for season nine from late 2022) and different rules and cost controls and technology diversification will allow for the championship still to be the main provider of electric technology.""

Vettel, who won his titles with Red Bull between 2010-13, joined at the end of last year from Ferrari. Executive chairman Lawrence Stroll had assured reporters this week that the German was set to stay after media speculation he might not.
Stroll senior said also that he saw Lance, 22, as a potential champion.
The Mercedes-powered team are building a new factory at Silverstone and hiring staff with the aim of positioning themselves as title contenders within three to five years.
Stroll will be starting his sixth season in Formula One next year after making his debut with former champions Williams in 2017.
Lawrence Stroll said the line-up blended youth and experience while team principal Otmar Szafnauer hailed Lance as ""one of the most gifted drivers in modern Formula One"" and Vettel as ""a massive asset"".
""Next year we expect both of them to race well in what will be a very different formula from the current one,"" added Szafnauer.
Formula One faces a major shake-up in 2022, with new aerodynamic rules aimed at making racing more competitive.
Aston Martin, the renamed Racing Point team that was previously Force India and started out as Jordan in 1991, are currently seventh of 10 in the constructors' standings.
They finished fourth last year, despite being docked 15 points that would have put them ahead of McLaren, but have been less competitive this year due to regulation changes over the winter.
Vettel, disqualified from second place in Hungary in August for not having enough fuel left in his car, has scored 35 points from 14 races and Stroll 24 although the Canadian has had more top 10 finishes.
""I am really looking forward to racing the new generation of Formula One cars.

The seat at the Swiss-based team is the only one with any lingering uncertainty around it, after Aston Martin confirmed an unchanged lineup on Thursday, and a fistful of candidates are keen to fill it.
One of them is China's Guanyu Zhou, currently second overall in Formula Two and test driver for the Renault-owned Alpine Formula One team.
The 22-year-old is 15 points behind Australian Oscar Piastri, who is also a member of the Alpine Academy.
Shanghai-born Zhou is considered a favourite, with reported substantial backing from Chinese sponsors, in a move that would also delight F1's commercial rights holders Liberty Media.
China is a key growth market for the sport, along with the United States, and first hosted a grand prix in Shanghai in 2004.
No Chinese driver has come closer to the starting grid than taking part in Friday practice, however. 
Zhou did that with Alpine, who have no vacancies at their own team, in July while Ma Qing Hua featured in Chinese Grand Prix practice with now-defunct Caterham in 2013.
Swiss-based Alfa Romeo has so far only confirmed Valtteri Bottas, who is moving from champions Mercedes as replacement for retiring fellow-Finn Kimi Raikkonen, with Giovinazzi's future uncertain.
Giovinazzi is backed by Ferrari, who provide Alfa's engines, and is Italy's only F1 driver.
The team are free to choose their drivers, however, and commercial considerations could come into play - with talk of Zhou attracting tens of millions of dollars to a privately-owned team languishing ninth out of 10.
Alfa team boss Fred Vasseur told reporters at last weekend's Italian Grand Prix that Zhou was one of five or six names under consideration.
""Zhou is doing a good job in F2; for sure he’s on the list,"" said the Frenchman.
""It's not only due to the fact that he’s Chinese, that he’s a front runner in F2. He’s won some races and I think every single team in F1 is looking at him.
""We will see in two or three events where we are, what is the evolution of every single driver in F2.""
Alfa Romeo also have rising Sauber academy star Theo Pourchaire to consider but the Frenchman has only just turned 18 and lacks F1 track time, making him more of a prospect for 2023. Sauber run the team under Alfa branding.
Mercedes want to place their Formula E champion Nyck de Vries, who won the F2 title in 2019, but the Dutch driver's ties to the German manufacturer are a complication for a team closely linked to Ferrari. 
""I think the situation with Mercedes, it’s not an easy one,"" said Vasseur.

Bottas, who led Hamilton in both of Friday's sessions, ended the day with a fastest time of one minute 33.593 seconds, with the Briton just 0.044 seconds behind his team mate. 
Hamilton's hopes of finally clinching a landmark 100th win and possibly retaking the championship lead received a boost, with Red Bull opting to fit title rival and championship leader Verstappen's car with a fresh engine that triggered penalties.
The Dutchman, who leads Hamilton by five points in the overall standings and was already carrying a three-place grid penalty for a crash that took both drivers out of the last race in Monza, was third and sixth quickest, respectively, in Friday's two sessions.
Bottas, a Sochi specialist who took his maiden Formula One victory at the track in 2017, is targeting his first win of the season.
But the 32-year-old, who is joining Alfa Romeo next season and has not won since last year's race in Russia, said he would be prepared to ""take one for the team"" and let Hamilton win if the situation arose.
Mercedes, 18 points clear of Red Bull in the constructors' championship, have won all seven races held in Sochi since the 2014 Winter Olympic venue first hosted a grand prix that year.
Pierre Gasly ended Friday's running third quickest for AlphaTauri, but the Frenchman lost his front wing after clattering over the kerbs in the closing seconds of the session.
Lando Norris, who completed a one-two for McLaren behind race winner Daniel Ricciardo at the last race in Italy, was fourth quickest ahead of Alpine's Esteban Ocon.
Carlos Sainz was seventh for Ferrari ahead of Fernando Alonso in his Alpine and Aston Martin's Sebastian Vettel.
Charles Leclerc in the other Ferrari, who like Verstappen will start from the back after a power unit change, rounded out the top 10.
Antonio Giovinazzi crashed his Alfa Romeo heavily at the Turn 9 complex, forcing a nine-minute halt to the session.
Hamilton also ran into one of his pitcrew after overshooting his marks while stopping.  
Kimi Raikkonen returned for Alfa Romeo after missing the last two races having tested positive for COVID-19. He ended Friday's running 12th.

The 23-year-old, who leads Mercedes rival Lewis Hamilton by five points in the overall standings, was already carrying a three-place grid penalty after a collision with the Briton in the Italian Grand Prix that put both drivers out of the race.
Drivers are allowed no more than three power units per season and exceeding that allocation triggers grid penalties.
Verstappen, who has won seven races this year to Hamilton's four, can still mitigate any damage to his title lead in Sunday's race with the Sochi circuit relatively easier to overtake on.
He took similar penalties in the 2018 Russian race but scythed through the field from 19th on the grid to finish fifth.
The engine penalty, however, does smooth Hamilton's path to a landmark 100th win.
His Mercedes team have been unbeaten in Russia since the race joined the calendar in 2014 and predictably dominated Friday's opening practice session with Valtteri Bottas leading Hamilton.

Verstappen, 23, leads Mercedes' Hamilton by five points in the championship after 14 of 22 races but will start Sunday's Russian Grand Prix from the back of the grid after an engine change.
Hamilton, 36, will be expected to regain the overall lead in Sochi, with a compliant team mate in Valtteri Bottas and at a track where Mercedes have won every race since the first in 2014.
The two title rivals sparred verbally on Thursday with Hamilton saying he knew from experience how much pressure Verstappen was under in chasing a first crown and the Dutch driver saying he was ""very chilled"" and loving the fight.
""I think Lewis trying to get his eighth title is under way more pressure than Max going for his first,"" said Horner.
""Max is just enjoying what he's doing, he's driving better than ever. If you want to look how he deals with pressure, just look at Zandvoort (Netherlands). The intense pressure he was under that weekend.
""He's enjoying driving the car, he's enjoying the challenge, he's enjoying the competition and he's got nothing to lose,"" added the Briton.
Verstappen won his home Dutch GP at Zandvoort on Sept. 5 from pole position and in front of a raucous 'orange army' of fans expecting no less in the first race in the Netherlands for 36 years.
That victory was his seventh of the season, compared to Hamilton's four, and put Verstappen back on top of the standings.
The Dutchamn and Hamilton then collided in the Italian Grand Prix on lap 26 of 53, both retiring.
""I think that he’s just really enjoying and relishing this battle,"" said Horner, whose team won four drivers' and constructors' titles in a row with Sebastian Vettel from 2010-13.
""It’s been a long, long time since we’ve been in a position like this. Of course that’s exciting for him and it’s exciting and motivating for the whole team.""
Horner would not rule out further fireworks between the two title contenders, with the biggest prize in motor racing on the line.
""They’re racers, they’re going to race,"" he said. ""To sit here and say they’re never going to touch each other again in the next eight races, I doubt (Mercedes boss) Toto (Wolff) has that control over Lewis and we don’t over Max.

Grosjean, who made his IndyCar debut last year with Dale Coyne Racing, secured one pole position and three podiums in his rookie season and will drive Andretti's DHL sponsored Honda entry next season.
""I'm delighted to be joining Andretti Autosport and driving the No. 28 DHL Honda for next season,"" Grosjean said in a statement.
""It's a big honour to be joining such a great team as Andretti, anyone in the motorsport world knows the name Andretti. I'm super happy and proud to be racing with the team.""
Grosjean previously spent nine seasons in Formula One with teams such as Lotus and Haas and although the 35-year-old never won an F1 race, he secured 10 podium finishes.
The Frenchman's F1 career ended in a fiery crash at the Bahrain Grand Prix in 2020, where he suffered burns to his hands after his Haas car split in two when it penetrated a metal barrier and erupted in flames.
""We are thrilled to welcome Romain to the Andretti Autosport family,"" CEO and Chairman Michael Andretti said.
""He already had an impressive resume before coming to IndyCar and watching what he's been able to do in his rookie season here has been exciting to say the least.
""His vast motorsport experience will be beneficial to the team alongside our already strong 2022 driver lineup.""

583,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/us-tighten-grip-ryder-cup-after-another-day-domination-2201906,US tighten grip on Ryder Cup after another day of domination,"KOHLER, Wisconsin :The United States tightened their grip on the Ryder Cup with another day of domination at wind-whipped Whistling Straits on Saturday, taking a commanding 11-5 lead over holders Europe, who need to produce an historic comeback if they are to defend their title.
Comfortably in front 6-2 at the start of the day, the U.S. turned up the pressure in the morning foursomes taking three-of-four points before fending off a fight back from the Europeans in the afternoon fourballs splitting the matches 2-2.
Only nine times in 42 Ryder Cups has a team come from behind on the final day to lift the trophy.
No team has ever rallied from six points down going into Sunday's singles although twice (the U.S. in 1999 and Europe in 2012) teams have come from four back to capture the title.
""We are going out there until the end,"" assured Sergio Garcia, playing in his 10th Ryder Cup for Europe. ""We are not going to give up, that's for sure.""
Heading into Sunday's singles, the U.S. sit just 3 1/2 points away from the 14 1/2 they need to secure the little gold trophy.
It would mark just the second time in six Ryder Cups and third in last 10 that the U.S. has won the title.
While 40,000 mostly American flag waving fans will pour into Whistling Straits on Sunday in full party mode U.S. captain Steve Stricker and his men were not popping the champagne just yet.
""You're too far ahead of me,"" said Xander Schauffele, when asked to compare winning the Tokyo Olympic gold medal to winning a Ryder Cup. ""I don't think any of us are getting too far ahead of ourselves.
""It's 12 points for grabs tomorrow, and we are all trying to take care of our own business.""
Not since 1975 had the U.S. entered the second day of the Ryder Cup with a four-point cushion and Stricker wisely decided not to mess with success on Saturday, sending out the same four pairings for Saturday's foursomes as he did on Friday and returned the same result, a dominating 3-1 romp.
Heading into the afternoon fourballs, Stricker again mostly stuck with a winning formula going back to Bryson DeChambeau and Scottie Scheffler in one pair and Tony Finau and Harris English in another while throwing out two new combinations.
With the situation getting more desperate by the moment European captain Padraig Harrington searched for a lifeline.
In a bid to shake things up, Rory McIlroy was left out of a Ryder Cup session for the first time in his career sitting out the morning foursomes after dropping both his opening-day matches.
But Harrington recalled the Northern Irishman for the fourballs reuniting him with fiery Ian Poulter hoping they my light a fire.
The pair once again could not capture any past Ryder Cup magic the ""Postman"" Poulter failing to deliver the points the way he had so often done while McIlroy's record in at Whistling Straits dropped to 0-3-0.
The one bright spot for the Europeans has been Jon Rahm, who has performed like the world's top ranked player right from the outset, having a hand in 3 1/2 of Europe's five points.
Rahm and Garcia earned Europe's only win on Friday and picked up full points in both Saturday sessions. Rahm also teammed with Tyrrell Hatton for a half-point in Friday's fourballs.
But the contributions from the rest of the 12-man European squad have been sparse.
The only other pair to win a match were Hatton and Shane Lowry in the fourballs and that was only clinched on the last shot on the final hole when 2019 Open champion Lowry drained a nervy 10-footer for a 1-up victory over Finau and English.
""We've still got a chance. You're never out of the fight,"" said Hatton. ""Obviously we need a huge day tomorrow.
""Obviously that putt from Shane on the last was huge hopefully that gives us some momentum now going into tomorrow.""

582,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/norris-takes-first-f1-pole-hamilton-hits-wall-2201946,Norris takes first F1 pole as Hamilton hits the wall,":McLaren's Lando Norris seized his first Formula One pole position at the Russian Grand Prix on Saturday after seven- times world champion Lewis Hamilton hit the wall in a damp and dramatic qualifying session.
Ferrari's Spaniard Carlos Sainz joined the young Briton on the front row in Sochi with Williams' George Russell, Hamilton's Mercedes team mate from next season, completing a sensational top three against all odds.
Hamilton, who had been on provisional pole before everyone switched to slicks on a drying track, qualified fourth - making it three Britons in the top four - after a brush with the pit lane wall.
The team hurriedly swapped the front wing and got him back out on slicks in time for one more flying lap to the chequered flag but the tyres had lost temperature and Hamilton spun, with his fastest time remaining that set on the intermediates.
Hamilton can still expect to retake the overall lead from Red Bull rival Max Verstappen on Sunday with the 23-year-old Dutch driver starting at the back due to engine penalties. 
Mercedes have yet to be beaten in Sochi since the first grand prix there in 2014. 
Sainz had set the pace on slicks but Norris, 21, produced a final effort half a second faster in a qualifying session that had looked in doubt earlier in the day as rain swept in.
The 21-year-old Briton whooped in delight at what he hoped would be the first of many poles.
""It feels amazing... you never think you will get pole until you get it and now I've managed to do it. Extremely happy and big thanks to the team. They've done an amazing job,"" he said.
""It was tough. I am going to make myself sound good but it was tricky...The lap before I was two seconds down and I wasn't very confident we were going to improve on the previous lap...I risked quite a bit and it paid off. I'm a happy boy.""
Mercedes-powered McLaren won the previous Italian Grand Prix  in a one-two finish after Hamilton and Verstappen collided and took each other out.
Australian Daniel Ricciardo, winner on merit at Monza, qualified fifth in Sochi ahead of Spaniard Fernando Alonso for Alpine on a day of anxious weather watching after rain washed out final practice.
'INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED'
Hamilton, whose team mate Valtteri Bottas qualified only seventh, blamed himself.
""It was just a mistake from myself. I'm incredibly disappointed in myself,"" said a deflated Hamilton of his pit lane prang.
""Up until then I was in the groove, I was really in the zone.
""I'm really sorry for all the team that are here and back at the factory because obviously that's not what you expect from a champion. It is what it is and I will do my best tomorrow to try and rectify it.""    
Hamilton is still chasing a record-extending 100th Formula One win and his first since the British Grand Prix at Silverstone in July.
Aston Martin's Lance Stroll lines up eighth with Mexican Sergio Perez ninth for Red Bull and Esteban Ocon completing the top 10 for Alpine.  
Verstappen, five points clear of Hamilton after 14 races, made only a brief appearance in qualifying with nothing to achieve.
""We decided not to do too many laps as the risk of having a moment or an accident would not be worth it,"" he said.
""The track conditions were fine and there was good grip, I think it will be similar conditions during the race.""
Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Williams' Nicholas Latifi also start at the back due to power unit changes.

581,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/hamilton-denies-feeling-pressure-after-pitlane-slip-2202176,Hamilton denies feeling the pressure after pitlane slip,"    Lewis Hamilton denied he was feeling the pressure of the Formula One title battle after an 'embarrassing' and unusual pitlane error in Saturday's Russian Grand Prix qualifying left him fourth on the starting grid for Sunday's race.
The seven-times world champion, and most successful driver of all time, brushed the wall as he entered the pits for a change to slick tyres on a drying track in the final top-10 shootout.
The mistake, by a driver who makes very few, meant Hamilton had to wait for a new front wing and for team mate Valtteri Bottas to exit - costing precious time and, crucially, cooling his new set of pre-heated tyres.
""It was just a mistake from myself. I'm incredibly disappointed in myself,"" Hamilton told Sky Sports television.
""Up until then I was in the groove, I was really in the zone.
""I'm really sorry for all the team that are here and back at the factory because obviously that's not what you expect from a champion. It is what it is and I will do my best tomorrow to try and rectify it.""
Hamilton is five points behind Red Bull's championship leader Max Verstappen, who has to start at the back due to engine penalties - giving the Briton a golden chance to go back in front.
The Mercedes driver, who had been on provisional pole after the first laps on intermediate tyres, played down any suggestion that pressure had been a factor.
""It's really nothing to do with pressure, honestly, because it really wasn't that pressure scenario. It was literally just mistakes do happen,"" he said.
""I knew I didn't have a huge amount of time and I was attacking. I was just trying to get through the pit lane as quickly as possible because I knew I was going to need as much time on track as possible.
""I thought the track was drying and the grip was quite good and came in and just took it a little bit quicker than normal and just lost the back end and slid into the wall.
""Of course it's not what you would expect a world champion to do but the problem when you have the success that I have is that anything but perfection feels like a long way off. But I'm only human.""
Hamilton said his father called him afterwards, they talked things through and he was focused and ready to move on.
A win on Sunday would be his record-extending 100th in Formula One but the Briton has so far been unable to add to the 99th secured at Silverstone in July.
The champion said he was not superstitious, and the win would come.
""Of course I'll be giving it absolutely everything tomorrow, chasing that number 100. A big number. It feels like it's taken longer than ever before to get it but it's a pretty cool number to wait for,"" he said.

Race stewards noted in a statement that the Australian had taken immediate action as soon as he was aware of the Canadian's presence on a wet track and with heavy spray reducing visibility.
McLaren had warned Ricciardo, whose Monza win was the team's first victory since 2012, that team mate Lando Norris was coming up behind him but were unaware that Stroll was doing  consecutive fast laps and so said nothing about him.
The stewards deemed the situation bordered on 'unnecessary impeding' but opted for a reprimand as the most appropriate penalty.
The reprimand was a first of the season for Ricciardo, who qualified fifth while Norris took pole position - his first in Formula One.  
McLaren were given an official warning.

The Briton qualified third for Sunday's Russian Grand Prix after also starting on the front row alongside Verstappen in a rain-hit and farcical Belgian round at Spa-Francorchamps in August.
The 23-year-old, who is moving to Mercedes next season as Lewis Hamilton's team mate, has scored in three of his last four races - a remarkable turnaround for a team that had not previously taken a point in two years.
Once dominant champions in the 1980s and 1990s, Williams have been last in the standings for the past two seasons but have now risen to eighth.
""George for sure he’s a very, very good driver, but when you can do these kinds of things, it also shows that the car isn’t that bad,"" said Red Bull's Verstappen, who will start last on Sunday due to engine penalties.
""That car is not a Red Bull or a Mercedes but they also run more wing and more downforce, so naturally everything just starts to become a bit closer (in changeable and wet conditions),"" the Dutchman added.
""Nevertheless he still did an amazing job but I think people have to understand that car isn’t as bad as people think it is.""
Mercedes boss Toto Wolff told reporters he would not be surprised to see Russell leading Sunday's race, with third place on the clean side of the track and in a good position for an aerodynamic 'tow'.
McLaren's Lando Norris, whose car also has a Mercedes engine, starts on pole for the first time. Seven-times world champion Hamilton will line up fourth at a circuit where Mercedes have always won.
Russell was first to pit for slick tyres in Saturday's qualifying, taking a risk that those more invested in the championship battle were not prepared to take and reaping the reward.
""It’s crazy, you know. It’s my second time in the top three in three or four events,"" he said.
""The team have done an amazing job once again, pitting at the right time and putting the right tyres on. It was tricky out there. 
""There was one dry line and if you were just a couple of centimetres too wide you would have been on the wet stuff and you would have been off.
""We will have a battle on our hands but we are pretty slippery on the straights, we have some nice straight-line speed, so we’ve got to go for the podium again - nothing to lose.""

Red Bull's Max Verstappen finished an impressive second at Sochi's Olympic Park, after starting 20th and last due to engine penalties, thereby limiting the damage from his rival's fifth win of the season and first since July.
Spaniard Carlos Sainz was third for Ferrari on a day of hope and ultimate heartbreak for McLaren's Lando Norris as a late downpour dashed his hopes of a first win.
The 21-year-old Briton started on pole for the first time in his career, lost out to Sainz at the start but then passed the Spaniard 13 laps later and was still leading when the clouds burst.
Norris decided to stay out on slicks, after Hamilton had stopped for intermediates on team advice, with the top two comfortably clear of the rest.
He then plunged from first to seventh in the last three laps after slipping, sliding off and eventually having to pit.
""What a race the weather provided. It's taken a long time to get to 100 and I wasn't sure it would come,"" said Hamilton, who last season passed Ferrari great Michael Schumacher's previous record of 91 wins.
""Max must've done a really great job to come up to second from last. We've got our work cut out,"" added the Briton, who started the day five points behind Verstappen with seven races remaining after Sochi.
Hamilton had slipped to seventh at the end of lap one, losing out at the start after being fourth on the grid, but made up places as those ahead of him pitted early.
He was still 25 seconds behind Norris after his final stop but the team had read the weather right and the tyres easily allowed him to catch up and overtake his compatriot for a landmark win.
""The team made a great call right at the end. I didn't want to let Lando go and I didn't know what the weather was doing,"" said Hamilton.
""It would've been tough to get past Lando unless we came up to some traffic or he made a mistake, which he hasn't been doing, so then the rain came and it was very opportunistic.""
While Hamilton celebrated a personal century, his Mercedes team maintained their own 100per cent record in Sochi.
The champions have won every Russian grand prix since the first in 2014, Hamilton triumphant in five of them.
Australian Daniel Ricciardo, winner of the previous race at Italy's Monza circuit, was fourth for McLaren, with Valtteri Bottas fifth for Mercedes after starting 16th. Both benefited from stopping early for the treaded tyres.
Double world champion Fernando Alonso was sixth for Renault-owned Alpine.
Kimi Raikkonen, returning for Alfa Romeo after missing the previous two races due to a positive COVID-19 test, was eighth and Mexican Sergio Perez ninth for Red Bull.
George Russell, who had started a stunning third for Williams, struggled to 10th - his fourth points finish in the last five races for a team that had not scored for two years before that.
The only consolation for Norris, and it was a scant one on an afternoon that had offered so much more, was a bonus point for fastest lap.
Mercedes stretched their lead over Red Bull in the constructors' standings to 33 points.
Haas driver Mick Schumacher, son of Michael, was the only retirement from the race.
The next round is at Turkey's Istanbul Park on Oct 10.
Hamilton won his record-equalling seventh title there last November in a wet and slippery race but this year's championship chase looks like going the distance.","['578_0', '578_1', '578_2', '578_3', '578_4']","[""\n      Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton acknowledges the fans after winning the race.

The 23-year-old Verstappen had started last after taking on a new engine that exceeded his permitted allocation but he crossed the line behind Mercedes title rival Lewis Hamilton, who celebrated his 100th win, after perfectly timing his switch to intermediate tyres during a late rain shower.
“Today was like a victory for us,” Horner told reporters via video conference, adding that pre-race simulations had thrown up fifth place as the best result Verstappen could have achieved.
“To come from 20th on the grid to second, I think if anybody had offered us that… we would have bitten your arm off.”
Having gone into the weekend with a five-point lead over Hamilton in the championship battle, Verstappen leaves Russia with a two-point deficit to his British rival.
But, crucially, the Dutchman got his power-unit penalty out of the way, with Hamilton possibly still needing to take an extra power unit and associated grid drop at a later race.
Horner said the rain, and Verstappen’s call to pit for the intermediate tyres, had been crucial to securing the result.
Struggling with graining on his tyres, Verstappen was running sixth before the shower hit and had even been overtaken by the Alpine of Fernando Alonso.
“Max got the call right to go on the inters and it worked out well for him,” said Horner. “The rain the last five laps came at the right time.”
Sunday's race in Sochi, where Hamilton's win defended Mercedes's unbeaten run at the track, and the previous race at Italy's Monza, where the two title rivals collided and crashed out, were held at venues that have traditionally suited the champions.
With seven races to go, Horner said it was all to play for.
""To come away from two Mercedes strongholds with only a two-point deficit in the drivers' championship is hugely encouraging.

The world governing body has allowed players to be accompanied by close family during the T20 World Cup, which will end with the final in Dubai on Nov. 14, but they would also have to be part of the restricted environment.
There will, however, be arrangements for outdoor recreation.
""For example, it will be possible for them to play golf on a golf course where we have set aside the area for them and we can keep them separate from other people,"" said Marshall. 
""So we maintain managed environment, but we do allow people to do things other than sit in their hotel rooms.""
The ICC has put in place the support system after liaising with organisers of the Tokyo Olympics, Formula One and the European Championships and have also set up a bio-safety scientific advisory group comprised of experts.
Marshall, however, warned players to adhere to the rules.
""All these events depend on good discipline,"" he said. 
""If people stick to the rules, and maintain their discipline, we should not have any problems. And we would expect management of any team who finds people not adhering to the rules, to take that very seriously.""

South African van der Merwe and Briton Roberts helped former Haas driver Romain Grosjean make a 'miracle' escape from a fiery Bahrain Grand Prix crash last year and were hailed as heroes after the drama.

The 24-year-old Red Bull driver is two points adrift of Mercedes' seven times world champion, and 100-times race winner, Hamilton ahead of Sunday's Turkish Grand Prix, with six races remaining after Istanbul.
Verstappen has won seven times this year compared to Hamilton's five.
""We are very relaxed but also very focused and of course we want to win,"" the Dutch driver told reporters. ""There's nothing you can force or you have to stress about because we always want to do the best we can anyway.""
Verstappen said he was not thinking about the final outcome too much.
""If that’s going to be, at the end of the year, first, that's of course an amazing achievement and that’s what we work for, right?,"" he added.
""But even if we would finish second, I think we still would have a great season and at the end of the day it’s not really going to change my life.
""I enjoy what I’m doing and I think that’s also very important. For me there is not much to worry about, really.""
Hamilton won in Istanbul last year on a wet and slippery track, while Verstappen ended up sixth, but this year's race is a month earlier and the surface has been water-blasted to make it more abrasive.
Double world champion Fernando Alonso told reporters separately that Verstappen, who became the sport's youngest ever race winner in 2016 at 18 years old, seemed to deal with the pressure better than others.
""It seems that for him it is not a big deal every weekend and he takes it race by race. I think that's the right approach for these remaining races,"" said the Spaniard.
Four times world champion Sebastian Vettel said it remained to be seen how it would all play out.
""If you care about something really much, it's difficult to be always cool and always in control,"" said the Aston Martin driver. ""Is it helpful to be in control? I think most times yes, but I think time will tell.
""Will it change his life? He has to judge if it will or not. In the bigger scheme of things, he's young and he has time. He's been around five or six years now, he's not a newcomer anymore.""

573,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/deschamps-finds-right-formula-again-france-2229566,Deschamps finds the right formula again for France,"TURIN, Italy :     There were plenty of question marks over Didier Deschamps and his France side after their disappointing Euro 2020 campaign but their performance in a 3-2 comeback win over Belgium in the Nations League semi-finals on Thursday, answered many of them.
This was not the France that went out of the Euros in the last 16 with a penalty shootout defeat by Switzerland, instead there was a verve and confidence about the team that grew throughout the match, despite them falling two goals down in the first half.
France now take on Spain in Sunday's final at the San Siro and while Luis Enrique's young side were hugely impressive in their 2-1 victory over Italy on Wednesday, Deschamps knows his team will offer a sterner test of the Spanish defence than the Azzurri mustered.
The central issue against the Belgians was whether the front three of Kylian Mbappe, Karim Benzema and Antoine Griezmann could truly click together and the evidence at the Juventus Stadium was that they could.
Mbappe and Benzema, who both got on the scoresheet, were looking for each other immediately, searching out ways to open up the Belgian defence while not losing their own individual killer instincts.
Griezmann floated in spaces behind the front two and on occasions drifted out wide and while he may need more time to adjust to that way of playing, the signs were clear that it is an approach worth persevering with.
The three also pressed the Belgian defence hard - a key approach when there were only two 'classic' midfielders behind them.
WING BACKS
But even more encouraging for the France coach was the way in which his 3-4-3 formation worked, in particular the contributions from his two wing backs.
Benjamin Pavard on the right and Theo Hernandez on the left, showed the energy, speed and willingness to attack that is vital to the modern wide player.
There was no stronger illustration of how well that aspect of the formation worked than the 90th-minute winner with Pavard's low cross finding its way across the box to Theo Hernandez who drilled home.
The absence of N'Golo Kante from central midfield meant Paul Pogba and Adrian Rabiot had a lot of responsibility in the centre of the park but with Belgium moving the ball quickly to their forwards and to the wings they didn't face sustained examination.
That will be different on Sunday against a Spain side which has a much stronger tendency to rotate the ball in central areas with their possession game and where Pogba and Rabiot will have to be much more conscious of the spaces around them.
""It's a new system, we need time,"" said Deschamps, who has tried the formation in the past, most noticeably in the painful loss to the Swiss.
But there was another element, essential for any successful team, that the French showed as they turned the game around after going in 2-0 down at the break.
""Winning the match in that way shows the strength of character of the squad. The players never give in,"" said Deschamps, while Pogba said that if there was a video of the discussions in the dressing room at halftime it would be revealing.
Now Deschamps has a chance to add a Nations League title to the World Cup his side won in 2018 and if the two semi-finals are any guide - Sunday's final should be essential viewing.

572,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/hamilton-take-grid-drop-turkey-after-engine-change-2230731,Hamilton to take grid drop in Turkey after engine change,"ISTANBUL :Seven-times Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton will take a 10-place grid penalty for the Turkish Grand Prix after Mercedes changed the engine on his car on Friday amid reliability concerns.
The new internal combustion engine (ICE) exceeds the Briton's allocation of three for the season, triggering the penalty.
Hamilton is two points clear of Red Bull's Max Verstappen with seven races to go, including Sunday's at the Istanbul Park circuit, and any mechanical failure in a race would be a big blow.
Verstappen took a penalty at the previous rain-hit race in Russia, starting last but still finishing second to limit the damage.
Hamilton won in Turkey last year, clinching his record-equalling seventh championship. He had played down the need for an engine change on Thursday.       
Ferrari's Carlos Sainz has taken an entire new power unit as part of a planned upgrade and will start from the back of the grid.
Mercedes' head of trackside engineering Andrew Shovlin told Sky Sports television that the team had simulated all the races to the end of the year before deciding Turkey was the best option.
Hamilton famously went from 19th to second at the Istanbul circuit in a GP2 race in 2006, the year before his Formula One debut with McLaren.
""This is a circuit, you remember Lewis and that GP2 race, where he felt there's a lot of opportunity and it should make for an exciting Sunday,"" said Shovlin.
Hamilton would have gone to the back of the grid had Mercedes changed all the elements in the power unit but Shovlin said changing the engine covered most of the risk and anything more was 'a lot of fairly intrusive work'.
""Obviously the thing that you definitely don’t want to do is fail during a race and then have to take a penalty anyway,"" he said.
""And then there’s also a performance element, because the power units do lose a bit of horsepower over their life. 
""The bit that most contributes to that reliability element and the performance is the ICE itself and it’s better to take 10 places than start from the back.""
Hamilton lapped fastest in first practice, four tenths of a second quicker than Verstappen.

Verstappen was second in the morning session at Istanbul Park, 0.425 behind his Mercedes rival, and only fifth in the afternoon when he was slower than Mexican team mate Sergio Perez.
Hamilton will have a 10-place grid penalty for Sunday's race after exceeding his season's engine allocation but Mercedes hope he will be able to make up places at a track with good overtaking opportunities.
The seven times world champion lapped with a best time of one minute 23.804 seconds after leading in the morning with  1:24.178.
""So much more grip than we've ever had before,"" said the Briton, who won last year when the track was newly resurfaced and super-slippery in the wet. ""So it's made it a much more enjoyable track to drive.""
""I don't know how much more (performance) there is but we always find something during the evening so I definitely think I'll be able to find a little bit over tonight and tomorrow.
""And then I have a lot of work to do on Sunday.""
Verstappen, two points behind Hamilton with seven races remaining, was 0.635 slower in the second session on a clear afternoon.
""We've got a little bit of a balance mish-mash at the moment,"" Red Bull team boss Christian Horner told Sky Sports. 
""And the circuit is a lot grippier than it was last year and we're just a little bit out of the window with Max on set-up.
""It's going to be a busy night tonight, burning the midnight oil with the engineers and no doubt back in Milton Keynes as well ... we know we've got a good car so it's just a matter of getting into that window. I don't think we hit that today.""
Verstappen said he had tried out various changes in session two but was ""still looking around a bit at what to do... today wasn't the best of days.""
Ferrari's Charles Leclerc ended the day second and 0.166 off Hamilton's time.
Red Bull were debuting a one-off, mostly white, livery to honour departing engine partner Honda on what would have been the Japanese manufacturer's home race weekend at their Suzuka circuit.
That race was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and replaced by Turkey.    
Hamilton's team mate Valtteri Bottas, who will be expected to make the most of the Briton's penalty, was fourth and third respectively on a track with much more grip than last year's slippery surface.
Spaniard Carlos Sainz was fifth for Ferrari in the morning, but he will start Sunday's race from the back of the grid due to penalties resulting from a new upgraded power unit in his car.
Esteban Ocon lapped sixth fastest for Alpine on hard tyres in the morning with McLaren's Lando Norris, on pole at the previous round in Russia and leader until he made the wrong tyre call when rain fell late in the race, in seventh.
Norris was sixth in the afternoon with Alpine's Fernando Alonso seventh.
Hamilton said all would be hard to pass in Sunday's race.

Turkey returned last year after an absence of nearly a decade, with Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton clinching a record-equalling seventh championship in a wet and slippery race.
Istanbul Park operator Intercity has been seeking a long-term contract since then, but the announcement last week of a 10-year deal with Qatar from 2023 has added a further complication.
The sport will have a record 23 races next year already and could stretch to 24 in 2023.
Domenicali said, however, that it was ""a matter of having the right mix"" and aligning ""strategic goals"".
""Of course there are discussions that are taking place over the next days, weeks,"" he told reporters after an event at the Istanbul Bourse.
""The calendar is for sure full, but there are places where maybe we have other choices for the future.""
Speaking alongside Domenicali, Intercity Chairman Vural Ak said they were working to secure a contract of up to 10 years.
""As Mr Domenicali said, there may be many things that change - it's full of surprises - but as Intercity Istanbul Park we are always ready,"" Ak added. 
Despite the track being popular with drivers, the Turkish Grand Prix drew low crowds when Turkey hosted races between 2005-2011. 
Intercity have said they expect some 100,000 fans to attend over this weekend. Fans could be seen forming long queues at the circuit entrance ahead of Friday's practice sessions.

Formula One is due to publish its 2022 calendar at the end of next week but chief executive Stefano Domenicali has already said there will be 23 rounds, and that could be stretched to 24 in 2023.
Saudi Arabia and Qatar are new on the calendar this year, with the latter absent in 2022 but having a 10-year deal from 2023, while Miami makes its debut next season.
""We know now that we have 23 races. It’s fantastic, good job from FOM (Formula One Management), I am looking forward to it,"" Tost, an Austrian, told reporters ahead of the Turkish Grand Prix.
""Regarding the people at the track. First of all, we are a race team. They all should be happy that we have as many races as possible,"" he added.
""I think we all should be happy that we are in a position to be in Formula One and to have 23 races. And if someone doesn’t like it, then he should go.""
Tost said his Red Bull-owned and Italy-based team took care of their people, with race mechanics having three or four days off after a grand prix weekend.
He recalled also that in days gone by teams filled the gaps between races with testing, putting further strain on engineers and mechanics.
The number of races scheduled has been a concern for teams, with the bigger ones rotating staff while smaller ones worry about the risk of burnout and a high turnover.
They are also concerned about the stress of prolonged time away from family, particularly when strings of races are held in countries far from home.
Teams face a triple-header with races on successive weekends in Mexico, Brazil and Qatar next month.
Aston Martin's Otmar Szafnauer said it was good to have so many countries eager to host races but teams had to be mindful of their staff.
""We have put operations in place both back at the factory and at the race track to make the travel as comfortable as possible for them, including sometimes rotating people and some other organizational changes,"" he said.

Turkey returned to the F1 calendar in 2020 after nearly a decade away with a resurfaced track that lacked grip in wet conditions.
The drivers were unimpressed and organisers reacted to the criticism ahead of this weekend's Turkish Grand Prix by water-blasting the asphalt to make it more abrasive.
Mercedes' world championship leader Lewis Hamilton, who last year called the track ""terrifying"" and joined other drivers in comparing the surface to ice, said after lapping fastest in Friday practice that the track was ""much, much different"".
""I didn't really know what to expect when we went out there today but, Jeez, so much more grip than we've ever had before,"" said the seven times world champion who smashed the track record. 
""It's intense how much grip there is out there, which is awesome. 
""So it's made it a much, much more enjoyable track to drive, much more like it was before (years ago),"" said the Briton, who will be taking a 10-place grid penalty on Sunday for exceeding his season's engine allocation. 
Hamilton's Red Bull championship rival Max Verstappen, who was off the pace in Friday's practice, said the track was now ""super-nice"".
McLaren's Daniel Ricciardo said the track was ""completely different"" to last year, adding his car was a lot quicker than in the 2020 race.
Istanbul Park, which hosted F1 between 2005-2011, offers good opportunities for overtaking but weather forecasts have shown rain is expected this weekend and strong winds posed a challenge for some drivers on Friday.

American motorsports website Racer.com reported that 'significant talks' were set for the U.S. Grand Prix in Austin later this month.
Motorsport.com cited multiple sources on Saturday saying Andretti Autosport was closing in on a deal to take a majority stake, with talks at a very advanced stage.  
Michael Andretti - a former IndyCar champion, grand prix racer and son of 1978 Formula One world champion Mario - has spoken previously of his interest in acquiring a Formula One team.
""There’s a lot of reports, rumours, and that stuff,"" the IndyCar team owner, who also has interests in the electric Formula E and Extreme E series as well as sportscars, told Reuters last month when asked about speculation.
""I’ve been working on it (taking over a team) for a long, long, time.  When the right opportunity comes up I’m going to jump at it. Nothing new to report at the moment, but, who knows?""
Racer.com reported that Andretti had also 'tentatively spoken' to Williams and Haas but talks with Sauber had made progress.
The Andretti family set up a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) this year to raise US$250 million through an initial public offering.
The United States is a key market for Formula One, with a new race in Miami joining the calendar next year and a growing audience thanks to the popular Netflix 'Drive to Survive' documentary series.
A budget cap introduced this season, which will drop to US$140 million in 2022 and US$135 million in 2023, and financial barriers to new teams entering above the existing 10 outfits add to the attraction of a takeover.
Alfa Romeo team principal Frederic Vasseur could not comment on the speculation when asked at the Turkish Grand Prix on Friday.
""I’m the CEO and team principal and these kind of discussions are not with me, it would be with the shareholders,"" said the Frenchman. 
""We have so many rumours and so on that you have to ask the question to the shareholders of the company.""

""My eyes are still solely set on winning the race. It's going to be very hard, from 11th, but not impossible ... so just staying on my toes and making sure that we deliver maximum attack tomorrow.""
Hamilton has three other Red Bull drivers ahead of him on the grid, with Verstappen's Mexican team mate Sergio Perez on the third row while Pierre Gasly and Yuki Tsunoda, from Red Bull's sister team AlphaTauri, are fourth and ninth.
McLaren's Lando Norris, who lines up seventh, said he expected to stay ahead of Hamilton for only a couple of laps.
""I'm not going to say I'm going to beat him because I'm not,"" said the 21-year-old, who started on pole in Russia and nearly won.
Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff saw it differently, suggesting ""progress will be a tough one"" with all the cars ahead of Hamilton starting on the same medium tyres except for Tsunoda on the softs.
""Yesterday in the long run at a certain stage we were behind a Haas and also Williams and it was very difficult to even come close. So I guess strategy is more going to be the one that helps tomorrow,"" he said. 
The qualifying times, however, highlighted Mercedes' performance advantage with Hamilton more than a second quicker than Norris, and eight tenths faster than Perez.
Hamilton said he would just take it one step at a time, and had to get through the opening lap safely first from his midfield position.
""If I can be higher up early on, then great. I've got to stay out of trouble of course, and that will be probably my priority initially, and then see if it's possible to pick them off one by one.""

The 22-year-old rookie son of seven-times world champion and former Ferrari great Michael will start 14th after taking part in the second phase of qualifying for the first time.
Ferrari-powered Haas are last in the championship and the only one of the 10 teams yet to score a point in 15 races this season.
""We didn't only get lucky, (the team) did a good job,"" Steiner told reporters. ""Everything was done good. It shows you just have to keep working and things will come to us.
""That was my personal greatest satisfaction today, to see how the team executed. We are ready for next year, we are fine,"" he added.
""If we have a better car, the race team is ready to get some points.""
Formula One is embarking on a new era next year with a rules revolution aimed at making a more level playing field and with closer racing.
Haas have already announced that Ferrari academy driver Schumacher and Russian team mate Nikita Mazepin, whose billionaire father runs title sponsor Uralkali, are staying in an unchanged line-up.
Schumacher's performance equalled the German rookie's best grid spot, achieved in Russia two weeks ago after some drivers took penalties. 
He also reached the second qualifying phase in France in June but was unable to take part with the car too badly damaged from crashing in the final seconds of the opening stint.
Schumacher, last year's former Formula Two champion, said he had never doubted his abilities and praised the team's progress this season.
""Just really happy right now and happy we managed it as a team and got it on merit,"" he said.
""The progression was always there and on the way up and that's something we have to keep until the end of the season.""

Sainz prevented McLaren rival Daniel Ricciardo from going further than the first stage and then helped team mate Charles Leclerc reach the final phase with a useful aerodynamic 'tow' on his final run.
""Carlos showed great team spirit,"" said Ferrari racing director Laurent Mekies.
Leclerc ended up fourth fastest but will start third as a result of Mercedes' championship leader Lewis Hamilton, who was quickest, taking a 10-place penalty for exceeding his season's engine allocation.

""I did the best I could to help him (Leclerc),"" Sainz told reporters. ""We also managed to bump out Ricciardo... our direct competition, so it was a perfectly executed quali,"" the Spaniard added.
McLaren and Ferrari are locked in a tight battle for third in the Formula One constructors' championship, with McLaren 17.5 points ahead of the Italian outfit with seven races left. 
Ricciardo won last month's Italian Grand Prix with team mate Lando Norris second. Ricciardo and Norris will start 15th and seventh respectively on Sunday.
""As you see where Charles is right now, not to have two cars up there feels like a bit of a missed opportunity,"" said Sainz, whose car now has the upgraded Ferrari power unit that Leclerc used for the first time at the previous race.
Asked about his prospects, Sainz said he would do his best to overtake.
""We are going to try to recover, we're going to try to be aggressive tomorrow, we have to,"" he said.

Mercedes would have had a front row lockout at Istanbul Park after Saturday's qualifying, but for Hamilton collecting a 10 place grid penalty for an engine change that exceeded his allocation.
Instead team mate Valtteri Bottas will start on pole with Red Bull's Max Verstappen, two points adrift of Hamilton in the standings with seven races remaining, alongside on the front row.
Horner told Sky Sports television he expected Hamilton to make swift progress from 11th.
""Lewis has looked probably the quickest he's looked all year here,"" he said.
""The Mercedes is hooked up around here, it's working well on this asphalt and this circuit and he's going to be coming through pretty quick. 
""So we've just got to focus on our own race, get the strategy right, reliability, all those factors and see how we pan out.""
Hamilton won on a slippery surface in Turkey last year from sixth on the grid, with Verstappen starting second but finishing sixth.
Verstappen will start Sunday's race on the 'dirty' side of the track, with less grip. 
Asked whether he had the pace to beat the Mercedes, the driver's answer was blunt: ""No. But we will of course just try to follow and see what we can do and see what happens in the race in general.""
The Dutch 24-year-old started the previous race in Russia at the back due to a similar penalty, ending up second, and indicated Hamilton could not expect an easy passage from other drivers fighting for position and points.
""It was fun, to be honest, seeing other guys battle in front of you, almost getting taken out, all these kind of things... you just have to be very alert but I mean I think we have all faced these kind of things,"" he said.
""Some were fighting for their positions as well and then you get caught up in the fight they are in with other cars. Of course they are also trying to race for their best result. I had a good time in Russia.""

Verstappen, 24, was runner-up and 14.584 seconds behind the Finn at a wet Istanbul Park to overturn a two-point deficit to Hamilton and go six points clear with six races remaining.
Red Bull team mate Sergio Perez finished third with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc fourth and ahead of seven-times world champion Hamilton, who had started 11th due to an engine penalty.
""It's been a while, but feels good. I think from my side probably one of the best races I've had ever,"" said Bottas, who started on pole position and took a bonus point for fastest lap.
""Apart from that one little slide, everything was under control.""
The victory, sealed by overtaking Leclerc 11 laps from the end after the Ferrari driver had taken the lead by staying out while others pitted, was the Finn's first since Russia in September last year and 10th of his career.
Verstappen, who started on the front row, had a quiet race and said it had all been about tyre management.
""I'm happy to be on the podium. I think it's been close the whole year and I'm pretty sure in Austin it will be a good battle with Mercedes, so we just have to keep pushing, keep trying,"" he said.
The US Grand Prix in Texas is the next race on Oct 24.
Hamilton might have been on the podium but Mercedes called him in for a late stop from third place for a fresh set of intermediate tyres with the track drying.
""Why did we give up that place? We shouldn't have come in, man. Massive (tyre) graining. I told you,"" said the angry Briton in heated radio exchanges as he realised he had lost two places in the pits.
He noted afterwards that Alpine driver Esteban Ocon, who finished 10th, had made his one set of tyres last the entire race.
Had he stayed out and kept third, Hamilton would be only a point behind Verstappen.
""We thought we could finish third without stopping or, if a dry line emerged, maybe going to a soft tyre,"" said Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff.
""Then we saw Leclerc dropping off and Lewis was dropping off and it was clear we wouldn't make it to the end.""
Pirelli boss Mario Isola said the tyres would have been absolutely on the limit had Hamilton tried to last the entire race on them.
Spaniard Carlos Sainz was voted driver of the day for going from the back of the grid, due to power unit penalties, to eighth for Ferrari.
AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly was sixth with Lando Norris seventh for McLaren and Lance Stroll ninth for Aston Martin.
The start was clean but Gasly dropped from fourth to fifth after contact with Alpine's Fernando Alonso, who spun.
The Frenchman was handed a five-second time penalty but Alonso also collected a similar sanction for a later clash with Haas's Mick Schumacher.
Bottas was 1.6 seconds clear after three laps with Verstappen complaining soon after that he had problems with the gear shift.
Hamilton meanwhile worked his way through the field, 10th after the opening lap before passing AlphaTauri's stubbornly defensive Japanese rookie Yuki Tsunoda for eighth place on lap eight.
He passed Stroll a lap later, with Norris and Gasly taken in quick succession.
A worrying moment came at the halfway mark when he was lapping Haas rookie Nikita Mazepin only for the Russian to move across the track, the two cars avoiding contact but Hamilton losing time in his chase of Perez.
Hamilton and Perez went wheel-to-wheel through four corners as they fought for fourth, with the Mexican forced to run the wrong side of a bollard marking the pitlane entry as he held position and his team applauded.
With Ferrari finally recognising Leclerc had run out of tyres after Bottas passed him, the Monegasque pitted and was overtaken by Perez.",['560_0'],"[""\nFILE PHOTO: Formula One F1 - Turkish Grand Prix - Intercity Istanbul Park, Istanbul, Turkey - October 10, 2021  Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas crosses the line to win the race REUTERS/Murad Sezer\n""]"

The seven-times world champion said he obeyed against his ""gut feeling"" when told to pit late in the race while in third place. He had decided to stay out when given an earlier instruction.
The stop dropped Hamilton, who started 11th due to engine penalties, to fifth with Red Bull's Max Verstappen taking back the overall lead and going six points clear with six races remaining.
Hamilton, winner of a record 100 races, responded angrily when he discovered he had lost two places in the pits.
""We shouldn't have come in, man. I told you,"" he said over the radio.
""My gut feeling was to stay out, and I feel like that's what I should have done. So I'm frustrated in myself for not following my gut,"" the Briton then told Sky Sports television.
He had calmed down by the time he spoke to reporters.
""It was frustrating at the time. I could see second and all of a sudden I'm back in fifth,"" he said.
""I only have a certain amount of information and the team have other information. They see everyone else. For me it's hard to give something up when you don't fully know the whole picture.
""We win and lose as a team. I listened to the team today. Could we have stayed out? Who knows. If you look at a couple of other drivers who did, they dropped off massively and lost positions. So it was a risk either way.
""If I'd stayed out we don't know if I would have held position. But I'm a risk taker so I would have wanted to take that risk.""
Alpine's Esteban Ocon finished 10th on the same set he started with, on a wet afternoon too slippery for regular slicks.
Pirelli tyre boss Mario Isola doubted whether Hamilton would have been able to make the tyres last the full 58 laps and hold on to third place.
""Looking at the tyres after the race, I would say no or at least it was really at the limit,"" he said.
""It is a bit dangerous to push the boundaries like today but I fully understand that in race conditions they have to maximise the result.""
Isola said most of the cars that stopped close to the end had tyres worn down to the carcass and that were ""completely finished"".
""I was suggesting to our engineers to warn the teams to change the tyres, not to go to the end because it was a risky move,"" he added.

""It's been a while, it feels good,"" he said after winning from pole with fastest lap.
Bottas would normally be expected to play a supporting role to seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton but on Sunday he led from the front of the grid with his team mate starting only 11th after an engine penalty.
Hamilton ended up fifth, losing his championship lead to Red Bull's Max Verstappen who now has a six-point advantage.
Bottas said his win on a rain-affected afternoon was like ""night and day"" in comparison to last year's dismal outing in Turkey where he spun and dropped to the back on a slippery track.

MERCEDES (Valtteri Bottas 1, Lewis Hamilton 5)
Bottas won from pole position and set the fastest lap. It was his first win in more than a year and 10th of his career. Hamilton started 11th on the grid, due to an engine penalty, and was third when he made a late pitstop, losing two places. From being two points clear of Verstappen in the championship he is now six behind. Mercedes are now 36 points clear of Red Bull, a gain of three points.
RED BULL (Max Verstappen 2, Sergio Perez 3) 
Verstappen went back on top of the championship while Red Bull celebrated their second double podium finish of the season. The podium was Perez's first since France in June. Perez went wheel-to-wheel with Hamilton through four corners as they battled for fourth place in a highlight moment of the race.
MCLAREN (Lando Norris 7, Daniel Ricciardo 13)
McLaren's lead over Ferrari shrank by 10 points to 7.5. Ricciardo started at the back of the grid due to an engine change penalty and struggled with the tyres. The Australian had qualified 15th. Norris started seventh and said it had been a very long and tough race.
FERRARI (Charles Leclerc 4, Carlos Sainz 8)
Leclerc led once Bottas and Verstappen had pitted, staying out as long as he could before the tyres lost performance and he pitted on lap 47 of 58. Sainz was voted Driver of the Day for racing from 19th on the grid to eighth. He lost time in the pitstop, costing him a chance to attack Norris.    
ALPINE (Esteban Ocon 10, Fernando Alonso 16) 
Alonso made contact with Gasly at the first corner, spinning down the field. The Spaniard fought back but then banged into Schumacher's Haas and was handed a five second penalty. He came in for fresh intermediates on lap 31. Ocon did not pit, making one set of intermediate tyres last the entire race which is allowed under wet weather rules.     
ALPHATAURI (Pierre Gasly 6, Yuki Tsunoda 14)
Gasly was handed a five second penalty for the clash with Alonso, for which he apologised, but still finished 10 seconds from the podium. Tsunoda wore down his tyres battling Hamilton early on and then spun, dropping out of the points. The team closed the gap to Alpine to 12 points.     
ASTON MARTIN (Lance Stroll 9, Sebastian Vettel 18)
Vettel made a bold move to switch to slicks at his pitstop, which backfired and he had to pit again on the next lap to take on intermediates again. Otherwise he might have scored. Stroll lost some time in his pitstop but felt he got the most out of the car.
WILLIAMS (George Russell 15, Nicholas Latifi 17)
Russell started 13th and Latifi 15th and both made one stop. Russell lost positions at the start after Alonso's spin and a battle with Ocon. Latifi spun on the opening lap in what was his first fully wet race. He also lost time behind the Haas drivers.
ALFA ROMEO (Antonio Giovinazzi 11, Kimi Raikkonen 12)
The pair started 16th and 17th respectively but were 12th and 13th after the first lap. They passed Ricciardo with a lap remaining.
HAAS (Mick Schumacher 19, Nikita Mazepin 20)
Schumacher started 14th but the contact with Alonso sent him to the back of the field.

556,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/mbappe-and-benzema-show-spain-exactly-what-they-lack-2234511,Mbappe and Benzema show Spain exactly what they lack,"MILAN :     The Nations League Final Four may only be a bite-sized mini-tournament, but this week's action still provided a reminder of one of the game's most enduring truths - it is strikers that win matches.
France beat Spain 2-1 in Sunday's final at the San Siro stadium with goals coming from two of the finest forwards in the modern game - Karim Benzema, who struck a beautiful shot into the corner and Kylian Mbappe who showed outstanding composure for the winner.
In contrast to the world champions' clinical finishing, Spain had dominated the opening 45 minutes, enjoying two thirds of the ball possession but, playing without a recognised striker, they barely tested France keeper Hugo Lloris.
With first-choice centre forwards Alvaro Morata and Gerard Moreno missing this week's games due to injury, Spain coach Luis Enrique had opted against bringing in a 'pure' striker.
The absence of a real 'number nine' was barely noticed in Wednesday's 2-1 semi-final win over Italy, where winger Ferran Torres was given a central role and scored both the team's goals.
But against the French, Torres was moved back to his preferred position on the right of a three-pronged forward line and not only was he less effective in that position, without him Spain lacked a central presence.
Mikel Oyarzabal did most of the work down the middle with Pablo Sarabia coming in from the left wing more in the second half and for the most part, France's defence coped, despite losing Raphael Varane to injury in the first half.
Oyarzabal did put Spain ahead but after Benzema's wonderful curling effort to level and Mbappe's cool finish to put France ahead, Spain's frantic attacks lacked the presence of a centre forward.
Every time France attacked with Mbappe's directness, pace and disorientating movement and Benzema's constant probing for space, there was a sense of anticipation from their supporters.
In contrast, when Spain attacked, it was pleasing on the eye but rarely carried a sense of danger.
There is so much talent in Luis Enrique's highly promising side and teenagers like Gavi and Yeremi Pino showed here that the production line from LaLiga continues despite the financial problems at the country's two biggest clubs Real Madrid and Barcelona.
TOP STRIKER 
But for Spain to get back to the very top in the international game and regain the World Cup they won in 2010 or the European titles they won in 2008 and 2012, they will surely need to add a top striker to their long list of quality midfielders and wingers.
France though will head to the World Cup in Qatar next November with a frontline that, in itself, makes them one of the favourites.
Mbappe continues to develop as a player, his superb control and lightning pace, combined with a smartness in terms of his ability to exploit spaces and use the ball cleverly when others are in better positions.
Crucially he is now forming a genuine understanding with Benzema in their strike partnership. 
Not only are both capable of outstanding individual goals, but they combine with an effectiveness that coach Didier Deschamps would have hoped for when he brought Benzema back into the fold for June's European Championship.
With the subtle creativity of Antoine Griezmann just behind the pair, France have a front three that is arguably unmatched in the national team arena.
France beat number one ranked Belgium and then Spain without their key central midfielder N'Golo Kante, but with Paul Pogba delivering a fine all-round display in the final.
With the switch to using wing backs in a 3-4-3 formation, Deschamps appears to have found the right formula to get the most out of the talent at his disposal.
Luis Enrique has made real progress in rebuilding Spain after their struggles in the past few years and his side are capable of beating anyone when everything clicks - as they showed against Italy on Wednesday.
But how he must wish he had an Mbappe or a Benzema of his own.

The country's biggest tournaments were cancelled last year and this year's have been pushed back to early-2022 but organisers remain hamstrung by strict travel curbs and quarantine rules.
Australia's borders are effectively shut and unlikely to open to non-residents until 2022, while the mandatory 14-day isolation in quarantine hotels is putting off the nation's top players from returning home to support the domestic tour.
That adds up to a nightmare for tournament organisers whose supply of talent required to sign sponsors and sell tickets has been all but choked off.
""The uncertainty sort of puts us in a difficult situation,"" Sutherland said in an interview on Monday (Oct 11).
""From our perspective, we are just trying to get a little bit of certainty as to what things look like and may look like.
""There’s usually a bit of crystal balling there but unfortunately these players tend to make arrangements a long way in advance.""
The flagship Australian Open, which boasts former world number ones Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy among its recent winners, was pencilled in for late-January or early February last month after its November scheduling proved untenable.
Both the Australian Open and the 2022 women's event in Adelaide in February, which is also a stop on the elite LPGA Tour, are now in doubt.
""We’ve just got to now weigh up what do the events look like and is it possible to play at some lesser scale?"" said Sutherland.
""They’re the sorts of things we’re trying to work through at the moment.""
The loss of the tournaments would be another hammer blow for the local tour, while adding to a growing list of cancelled sport events in Australia.
Melbourne's Formula One Australian Grand Prix was postponed from its traditional March window to a November slot before being scrapped for a second year, along with motorcycling's MotoGP event at nearby Phillip Island.
Road cycling's Tour Down Under, a race on the top UCI World Tour, was cancelled last month, and there are doubts over whether the team-based ATP Cup tennis tournament can go ahead before the Australian Open Grand Slam at Melbourne Park in January.
Even organising small golf events for home-based players desperate for competition is proving a huge challenge for administrators, with Australia's southeastern states effectively isolated from the rest of the country while battling COVID-19 outbreaks.
""(That's) another layer of complexity with state borders and how players can move themselves around,"" said Sutherland.
""For players, time is money and they can’t afford two weeks in quarantine.""",['555_0'],"['\nJordan Spieth of the United States tees off in Sydney on Nov 20, 2016. (Photo: Reuters/Jason Reed)\n']"

The 24-year-old Dutch driver finished second to Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas at the Istanbul Park circuit to move six points clear of seven-times world champion Hamilton, who ended up fifth.
At the same time Red Bull fell further behind Mercedes in the constructors' standings, the gap now 36 points, and team boss Christian Horner expressed surprise at how much his rivals had picked up the pace.
""I think their straight-line speed has taken a significant step recently,"" he told reporters.
""Whereas we could match them with smaller wings previously now we can't get near.
""We saw that particularly at this circuit where Lewis in particular had a significant straight-line advantage with a bigger rear wing on the car. We've got to maximise our package as best we can.
""It's surprising that they appear to have made the step that they have with the power unit.""
Verstappen told reporters Red Bull needed to find more pace.
""They were definitely quicker this weekend,"" he said. ""We just didn't get it together and also in the wet they seemed to have a bit of the edge as well.
""I definitely do think they probably stepped it up a bit,"" he added.
Hamilton had been fastest in qualifying in Istanbul and would have started on pole position had his car's engine not been changed as a precaution, triggering a 10 place grid penalty.
""We haven't done anything to the car so I don't really know why that is the case,"" the Briton, who took his record-extending 100th career win at the previous race in Russia, said when asked about the improved performance.
""Maybe the two tracks we've just driven on suited us a little bit more. The car's been feeling good, it felt great this weekend.
""If the car continues to behave as it has this weekend, that's good for us.""
The last three circuits - Italy's Monza, Russia's Sochi and Turkey - have all been good ones for Mercedes in recent years but Red Bull have hung in there and come away with strong results to limit the damage.
While Mercedes-engined cars won all three races, it was Australian Daniel Ricciardo at Monza in a McLaren one-two after Verstappen and Hamilton took each other out.
Verstappen finished second in the other two, crucially ahead of Hamilton in Istanbul with team mate Sergio Perez third and Bottas no threat in the championship.
""Arguably this has been Mercedes' strongest circuit that we've seen so far this season so to have two cars on the podium and retake the lead in the drivers' championship is a positive day for us,"" said Horner.
""We know the next race in Austin has been a Hamilton stronghold for quite a few years now but then Mexico, Brazil hopefully, the higher altitude races have tended to be quite strong for us in the past.
""And then really not sure what to expect from the last three.""

The seven-times world champion, who started 11th on the grid due to engine penalties, was running in third place when he was told to pit for a tyre change, against his wishes of staying out in a bid to catch up with Red Bull's Max Verstappen.
Hamilton responded angrily over the radio when he discovered he had lost two places in the pits as he finished fifth, allowing Verstappen to build a lead of six points in the drivers' standings with six races left.
""Don't ever expect me to be all polite and calm on the radio when I'm racing, we are all very passionate and in the heat of the moment that passion can come out, as it does for all drivers,"" Hamilton wrote on Instagram on Monday.
""My heart and spirit are out there on the track, it's the fire in me that's got me this far but any angst is quickly forgotten and we talked it through, already looking ahead to the next race.""
Formula One tyre supplier Pirelli backed Mercedes' strategy on Sunday, with their head Mario Isola saying it was dangerous on Hamilton's part to push the boundaries of the intermediate tyres to 58 laps.
Hamilton had said after the race that it was hard for him to give up the position as he did not have the full picture.
""It isn't true to say I'm furious with my team,"" he added. ""As a team we work hard to build the best strategy possible but as the race progresses you have to make split decisions, there are so many factors constantly changing.
""Yesterday we took the risk to stay out hoping it would dry, it didn't. I wanted to risk it and try and go to the end, but it was my call to stay out and it didn't work. In the end we did pit and it was the safest thing to do.""

Van der Merwe, 41, and F1 doctor Ian Roberts tested positive independently for the coronavirus ahead of the race and did not travel to Istanbul, with the FIA's Formula E crew standing in.
Both had been in the medical car at the previous Russian Grand Prix in Sochi.
The South African said on Twitter it was the second time he had contracted COVID-19 and he had not been vaccinated for personal reasons.
""From what we understand, there are a couple of countries that you probably won't be allowed to enter ... unless you're  vaccinated,"" Formula One's race director Michael Masi told reporters on Sunday.
""You need to comply with those requirements to enter the country and from that perspective the FIA obviously has to respect the country's requirements to get in, as will all the teams and everyone else.""
Van der Merwe explained his position before the weekend, indicating he had received abuse on social media for his stance and would block those making personal attacks or wishing him fired.
""I am fully aware that I will potentially be less employable or that my freedom of movement will be restricted based on my choices,"" he said on Twitter.
""That I will not choose convenience over my own health does not mean I am making decisions out of selfishness. We all just want to be healthy.""
He said he would continue to observe public health guidelines, reduce risk as much as possible, and respect the decisions of others.
The remaining races this season are in the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi.
""In Switzerland (I’m half Swiss) and other developed countries, prior infection counts as much as a vaccine,"" said van der Merwe. 
""I trust that those countries know what they’re doing, and also respect countries’ more restrictive rules and not travel there.
""If you want to get vaccinated, do it. I’m pro-vaccine for those that want and can have them.""

Extreme E founder Alejandro Agag recognised that the 'Jurassic X Prix' at Bovington on Dec. 18-19 marked a shift from racing in remote places to highlight the effects of climate change.
""More increasingly the issues we talk about are literally happening in our backyards so it felt like the right time to bring the spotlight home, and help the army reduce its own carbon footprint,"" said the Spaniard in a statement.
Bovington, an extensive and off-limits area of forest and heathland, has been used for tank and artillery training by the British army for more than a century.
The army this year published a climate change and sustainability strategy, aiming to reduce dependency on fossil fuels, and mitigate the impact on the environment with new and cleaner technologies.
The Ministry of Defence also highlighted its role as the largest owner of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in England.
Britain is hosting the U.N. global climate change summit (COP26) in Glasgow from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12.
The series, which uses identical SUVs and includes male and female drivers in every lineup, lists Formula One world champions Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg and Jenson Button among team owners.
It aims to raise awareness about climate change and promote sustainability by racing in remote and harsh environments already suffering damage.
Extreme E in June cancelled races scheduled for Brazil's Amazon and Argentina's Patagonia regions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The other race venues have been Saudi Arabia, Senegal and Greenland. The penultimate round is being held in Sardinia this month.

Mercedes' seven times champion Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen have traded the lead repeatedly since March with the latter only six points clear after 16 of the scheduled 22 rounds.
Four teams and six drivers have won races so far, although Verstappen has won seven and Hamilton five.
""There is no doubt in my mind that the cost cap and the rules changes that were implemented are having a positive impact on the closeness and intensity of the championship,"" said Brawn in a column for the website.
""There is no capacity for a team to pour massive resource into a championship and try and run away with it. The resources are now limited and the teams are also focused on next year’s car, which is requiring a lot of time and resource.
""We still want a meritocracy. We still want the best team to win. But we don’t want them to win by a country mile simply because they’ve got a bigger budget than anyone else. It’s pleasing to see the way things are developing.""
Mercedes, winners of the past seven drivers' and constructors' championships, said in June that development on this year's car had stopped with the team focusing on major changes for next season.
The champions were 40 points behind Red Bull after eight races but are now 36 in front.
The US$145 million budget cap introduced this season is set to drop to US$135 million in 2023.
Red Bull boss Christian Horner told reporters after Sunday's Turkish Grand Prix that the variety of winners had been a great feature of the season - with Alpine's Esteban Ocon and McLaren's Daniel Ricciardo among them.
""It seems a shame to change it for next year, really,"" he added.
Brawn disagreed, saying there remained underlying problems to resolve with cars still struggling to follow each other closely.
""This weekend I heard some comments around whether the 2022 regulation changes are needed given we're currently enjoying such a golden season,"" he said.
""While the 2022 rules won’t change the situation overnight I think they are a much better platform to improve the racing on the track.""

The British-based former champions said they had also become the first F1 team to sign the UN Sports for Climate Action Framework.
Climate positive means going beyond achieving net-zero carbon emissions by removing additional carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Formula One aims to achieve a net zero-carbon footprint by 2030, with 100 per cent sustainable fuels introduced long before then, as it addresses questions about its relevance in a world increasingly focused on clean energy and climate change.
Champions Mercedes say they have already achieved a net zero carbon footprint.
""We have taken time to thoroughly analyse our entire operation and develop a comprehensive purpose-driven sustainability strategy to accelerate our sustainable transformation,"" said Williams chief executive Jost Capito.
""So today we are making the commitment to be climate positive by 2030 and we will be using our knowledge to nurture and develop advanced technology to meet this goal.""
Capito said Formula One had the power to inspire millions of people around the world and was the pinnacle of many advanced technologies.
Britain is hosting the COP26 UN climate change conference in Glasgow next month. The summit is billed as the last big chance for leaders to announce firm targets to cut climate-warming industrial emissions this decade.
Williams, who use Mercedes engines, listed five key pillars of its sustainability strategy.
They included reducing carbon emissions from travel, with the sport planning a record 23 races around the world next year and possibly more in years to come, and energy consumption at the factory.
The team will also seek to create their own energy and develop carbon capture technologies.

Seven-times Formula One world champion Hamilton had wanted to go the distance on intermediate tyres after starting 11th on a wet afternoon due to engine penalties but eventually pitted from third place.
The race cost the Briton the overall championship lead, with Red Bull's Max Verstappen moving six points clear after finishing runner-up to Hamilton's team mate Valtteri Bottas.
Hamilton had angrily questioned Mercedes' tactics at the time but the team's chief technical officer James Allison said the outcome would have been worse had he not followed instructions.
""In all likelihood, we would have got to the end of the race on one set of tyres, able to circulate without difficulty,"" said Allison.
""The question is, how quick would we have been? And the evidence there is pretty clear: we would have been very slow.
""Lewis's lap times were starting to get worse lap by lap by lap and while he would have made it to the end of the race, the pace would have been quite dismal by the time he got there.""
Allison said the optimum in hindsight would have been to have pitted around lap 36 or 37 while lap 41 would have been ""a fourth place type of stop"". Instead, Hamilton continued for another nine laps.
By then the prediction was that he would end up seventh or eighth without pitting.
""You can see why, if you are playing a hand of poker like that, you are going to choose the best option and the best option for us, having missed out on the earlier call, was to come in and secure that fifth place,"" said Allison.
He added that it was hard to see the team's pace in Turkey, with Bottas dominant in the race and Hamilton fastest in practice and qualifying, as a yardstick for the future.
""It was a very good performance, the car was very well-balanced, we didn't seem to suffer as much from the understeer that was fairly prevalent up and down the pit lane this weekend,"" he said.
""But I don't think you could read that automatically into the races to come.""
Allison said reliability, pitstops and weather would all be future factors but Mercedes were in with a fighting chance.
""It's a thrilling season and these last few races should make this a season that will be thought of for many years to come as one of the classics in F1,"" he added.",['548_0'],"[""\nMercedes' Lewis Hamilton after finishing the race in fifth place. (Photo: REUTERS/Umit Bektas)\n""]"

Multiple sources told Reuters on Thursday that China was not on a draft schedule presented to teams on Wednesday but would feature as a possible reserve for later in the season in the event of another round dropping off.
Formula One sees China as a key growth market but the race, usually in April, was cancelled in 2020 and this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and travel restrictions.
Italy's Imola circuit, brought back as a stand-in for cancelled races this year and last, is expected to take China's slot while Miami comes in as a second round in the United States.
This year's Chinese Grand Prix was originally postponed from April to later in the year due to the pandemic and then cancelled, with a revised 22-race calendar published.
China will be hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing in February and has cancelled or rescheduled global sporting events since the start of the pandemic.
Tickets for the Olympics are to be sold to spectators from mainland China only and unvaccinated athletes must spend 21 days in quarantine ahead of the Games.
Formula One chief executive Stefano Domenicali has already said the 2022 season will run from mid-March to mid-November, with the sport eager to avoid a clash with the World Cup in Qatar in late November and December.
Teams approved the draft calendar at a Formula One Commission meeting in London on Wednesday and it will now be submitted to Friday's meeting of the World Motor Sport Council.
The FIA said the Commission was also presented with positive feedback from stakeholders on two Sprint events held at Silverstone and Monza. A third sprint will be held at the Brazilian Grand Prix.
The sources said the number of sprint races was likely to double in 2022.
An update to the sporting regulations was also discussed at the meeting following this year's wet and farcical Belgian Grand Prix.
The rain-delayed race at Spa-Francorchamps ended after a couple of laps behind the safety car and without any overtaking allowed. Half-points were awarded with podium ceremonies carried out.
""The Commission ... asked that the Sporting Advisory Committee considers this topic at its next meeting to propose options for updated procedures and regulations,"" the FIA said in a statement.",['547_0'],"[""\nMercedes' Lewis Hamilton leads at the start of the race.

Races in Australia, Singapore, Canada and Japan - all cancelled for the past two seasons - were included in a season that marks the start of a new era for the sport with a major regulation change.
""Due to ongoing pandemic conditions, China will not be included on the 2022 calendar. China will be restored to the calendar as soon as conditions allow,"" Formula One said in a statement.
The season will start at Bahrain's Sakhir circuit on March 20 and end at Abu Dhabi's Yas Marina on Nov. 20, the championship's earliest finish since 2010.
Formula One is keen to avoid a clash with the soccer World Cup which kicks off in Qatar in late November.
The Miami Grand Prix on May 8 will be the sport's sole new race for 2022, providing a second round in the United States. The US Grand Prix in Austin, Texas, is on Oct 23.
This year was also supposed to have 23 races but ended up with 22, using Turkey's Istanbul Park and Portugal's Portimao circuits as stand-ins to fill gaps left by cancellations while Saudi Arabia and Qatar debut.
The 2020 season had only 17 races.

543,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/no-special-deals-allow-unvaccinated-players-australian-open-official-2253746,No special deals to allow unvaccinated players at Australian Open: official ,"MELBOURNE :     Australia's Victoria state will not do special deals with unvaccinated athletes to allow them to compete at major events, an official said on Tuesday, putting Novak Djokovic's Australian Open title defence and bid for the Grand Slam record in doubt.
World number one Djokovic, level on 20 Grand Slam titles with Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal, declined to reveal his vaccination status again this week and said he was unsure if he would defend his Australian Open crown as authorities work out COVID-19 restrictions for the tournament.
Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said he opposed special arrangements to let unvaccinated athletes compete in the state, which is scheduled to host the Grand Slam at Melbourne Park in January.
""On the question of vaccination, no,"" he told a media briefing.
""(The virus) doesn't care what your tennis ranking is, or how many Grand Slams you've won. It's completely irrelevant. You need to be vaccinated to keep yourself safe and to keep others safe.""
Tennis Australia, which organises the Grand Slam, declined to comment.
Victoria, which is due to exit a near three-month lockdown this week, recently included professional athletes in a vaccine mandate covering millions of ""authorised workers"", without clarifying whether it applied to athletes from overseas or other Australian states.
Andrews suggested the mandate covered international athletes, too.
""Professional sport is part of those (items on the) authorised worker list and they have to be double-dose vaccinated,"" he said.
Andrews said Victoria's stance could be a ""moot point"", given the federal government might not issue visas to unvaccinated athletes.
""I don't think an unvaccinated tennis player is going to get a visa to come into this country and if they did get a visa they'd probably have to quarantine for a couple of weeks,"" he added.
""I don't think that the person you indicated (Djokovic) or any other tennis player, let's not personalise it ... or golfer or Formula One driver will even get a visa to get here.
""If I'm wrong I'm sure the federal government will let you know.""
The federal government's home affairs department was not able to provide immediate comment. 
Australia's borders have been shut to non-residents through the pandemic, although authorities have issued visas to athletes and sports staff for major events, including the last Australian Open in February.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the government would relax border controls for residents and their overseas-based family members from next month but international tourists and other visa classes would have to wait longer.
Melbourne, Australia's second largest city, has been locked down since August as authorities scrambled to contain an outbreak of the highly infectious Delta variant.
Restrictions for the city's 5 million people will be eased from Friday when 70per cent of the adult population in Victoria is expected to be fully vaccinated.
Unvaccinated people, however, will remain barred from sports events along with restaurants, pubs and other parts of the economy.    
Andrews said the ban on unvaccinated fans may apply right through to the 2022 Formula One Australian Grand Prix in April.
""This is here for a while .... We're not going to be essentially encouraging people to not get vaccinated because they reckon they can wait a few months or a few weeks,"" he said.
""You can't wait out coronavirus.""

Swiss-based Sauber run the Alfa Romeo team and there is mounting speculation that Michael Andretti, a former grand prix racer and son of 1978 champion Mario, is close to a deal.
American motorsports website Racer.com reported however that no announcement was expected at this weekend's U.S. Grand Prix in Austin, Texas.
""Andretti's a great name. I know the family and I think they'd be a great addition to the sport, if it's true,"" Stroll told Reuters from Montreal ahead of Sunday's race when asked about the rumours.
""I don't know much about it other than that I heard in the paddock last race that there was potentially some activity there.
""I think they did a SPAC in the States and said they were going to look to buy something in motorsports. I fully get it, I see the logic.""
The Andretti family set up a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) this year to raise US$250 million through an initial public offering.
The United States is a key growth area for Formula One, owned by U.S.-based Liberty Media, with a second race in Miami coming in 2022.
Stroll, who made his money in fashion, bought a significant stake in British sportscar maker Aston Martin in 2020 and is the executive chairman. 
The Silverstone-based Formula One team he bought in 2018 now competes as Aston Martin and Stroll has big plans for the future.
A new factory and wind tunnel 'campus' is being built and the team this month launched a five-year sterling retail bond through the London Stock Exchange to help fund a project due for completion in three years' time.
Stroll said the offer was also a chance for the team's fans and employees to become financially involved with a minimum initial subscription of 1,000 pounds (US$1,376.40) and multiples of 100.
""This will be a substantial amount of what the total facility will cost,"" said the Canadian, who added that the latest cost estimate was around 220 million pounds.
Stroll said Formula One's introduction of a budget cap this season, dropping to US$135 million in 2023, would transform the business.
""Everybody is very focused on each of us being profitable. And Formula One teams, run properly, will be very profitable companies,"" he said.
""It's a lot easier to win when you're outspending the competition. That has now gone... that plays into the sweet spot of this team, who historically did more with less. 
""We'll be able to do more, we'll be at the peak of the budget cap, we'll be right up there.""
The value of Formula One teams has also been boosted by any new entrant having to pay a US$200 million fee to compensate the existing 10 outfits for their reduced future share of the sport's overall revenues.
This does not apply to anyone taking over an existing team.

The series is on the U.S. Grand Prix support programme at Austin's Circuit of the Americas and Powell leads 2019 champion Chadwick 3-2 on wins with both on 109 points and two races remaining.
Finland's Emma Kimilainen is third, 34 points behind.
The finale will be the first time the Formula Three-level series, which did not race anywhere last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has gone outside Europe.
""We’ve got a great showdown, a double-header, two drivers on equal points. They are both ridiculously determined and competitive,"" W series founder and chief executive Catherine Bond Muir told Reuters.
""There isn’t the same frisson between them as (F1 title contenders) Lewis (Hamilton) and Max (Verstappen) but there’s  certainly a huge amount of competition and the driver that doesn’t win the championship is going to be extremely disappointed.""
The series winner can return next season but will not be able to earn points towards a Formula One super licence if she does.
That means Chadwick at least is unlikely to return if she triumphs again in a series aiming to help women progress up the motorsport ladder. No woman has raced in Formula One for 46 years.
""I want to use and showcase W Series for what it is, which is a springboard and a platform to progress into higher categories,"" the 23-year-old told Reuters.
""Ultimately a lot rides on winning the title for that. That’s the main thing I’m looking at.""
Chadwick said acquiring the licence points was not such a big factor at this stage.
""There’s a lot more that I need to do and achieve (first) in other categories,"" she said.
The FIA Formula Three championship would be a possible next step but Chadwick, who also competes in the electric off-road Extreme E series and is a development driver for the Williams F1 team, was not getting ahead of herself.
""I said at the end of 2019 that it was probably going to be my farewell if I won,"" she said. 
""I’m not sure at the moment, just trying to work out plans for the future but in the short term the focus is on this weekend.""
Powell, 28, expected winning the title to also open doors for her.

Feedback from 167,000 fans, with an average age of 32 and coming from 187 countries, placed Red Bull's Verstappen top of the popularity stakes with McLaren emerging as the favourite team.
Monza, Spa-Francorchamps, Silverstone and Monaco were the most loved circuits.
The survey was commissioned by Formula One and Motorsport Network and conducted by Nielsen Sports, who said it was their largest ever involving a single sport.
Verstappen, leads Mercedes' seven times world champion Hamilton by six points with six races remaining and the 24-year-old Dutchman was particularly popular among the 25-34 age bracket and across all regions.
McLaren's 21-year-old Lando Norris, yet to win a race, was second overall but ranked highest by female fans.
Mercedes' Hamilton was third overall but top in Britain and among the over-45s.
""His appeal, and that of fellow multiple world champion Fernando Alonso, appears more polarized than most,"" the survey found.
Formula One chief executive Stefano Domenicali told reporters he was surprised, although the result could be explained by the generally younger demographic.
""For sure it's a sign that we don't have a problem with drivers for the future,"" he added.
McLaren's Australian Daniel Ricciardo was fourth, and second most popular among female fans, with Aston Martin's Sebastian Vettel, a four times world champion, fifth.
They were followed by Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Alpine's double world champion Alonso.
The results showed greater interest and engagement than before, with female participation in the survey growing to 18.3 per cent from a previous 10 per cent in 2017.
Three quarters of those who responded lived in a country with a grand prix.
Some 90 per cent of fans felt Formula One was ""the pinnacle of motorsport"" and 55 per cent said the sport was in better health than five years ago compared to a previous 25 per cent.
The survey said McLaren had ""experienced a renaissance"".
They were top in Europe, the Americas and Middle East and Africa but second to Red Bull in Asia-Pacific.
Nielsen Sport's Nigel Geach said McLaren's one-two at Monza in September, the month of the survey, had not skewed the results.
Ferrari, the sport's oldest and most glamorous team, had been top of every previous survey since 2006 but their 32per cent vote in 2017 slipped to 18 per cent.
Mercedes, winners of the past seven drivers' and constructors' titles, dropped from 16.2 per cent to 11.9 per cent and were fourth most popular.
Half of the fans watched Formula One on pay television and a majority played motorsport-specific video games. Some 64per cent of those aged 16-34 were active gamers.
""It's clear that we are reaching new fans, people that are also coming to the sport with a different vision,"" said Domenicali.
The survey found 55 per cent of fans also wanted Formula One to be a world leader in the development of 100per cent sustainable fuels.",['540_0'],"[""\nRed Bull's Max Verstappen waves to the fans after finishing the race in second place. (Photo: REUTERS/Umit Bektas)\n""]"

The 24-year-old told reporters at the circuit in Austin, Texas, that he had made an unscheduled detour via New York after missing his original flight from Nice in the south of France due to the mix-up.
""My NIE (National Interest Exception) hadn't been accepted at the airport, so I couldn't take the original flight, so we changed the flight and went to New York last minute,"" Leclerc explained.
""It was just one guy at the airport of Nice that for some reason didn't really know what was an NIE, and I got stuck there.
""He only realised one minute before closing the flight that the NIE was OK, but I didn't have my passenger locator form, so I had to stay in Nice.""
Leclerc said he flew instead to New York, a city he had never before visited, and spent a day there before going on to Milwaukee for the first NBA match of the season.

Formula One last raced at the Kyalami circuit, north of Johannesburg, in 1993 but there have been talks about a return.
Chloe Targett-Adams, the sport's head of race promotion, said in February that racing in Africa was a priority.
Miami is meanwhile scheduled to become the second US race next year, along with Austin, Texas, and there has been talk of an eventual third grand prix in Las Vegas.
""The place that I really feel is dear to my heart and most important for me is to get a race back in South Africa,"" Hamilton told reporters at Austin's Circuit of the Americas ahead of Sunday's grand prix.
""I think there's a great following out there and it would be great to be able to highlight just how beautiful the motherland is,"" added the sport's only Black driver.
Formula One last week published a record 23-race calendar for next year, with Miami in May and Austin in October.
""The US Grand Prix is fantastic and it is such a huge country, having just one race here for sure isn't enough to really be able to tap into the sporting culture here,"" said Hamilton.
""I think definitely you need to have at least two. But there are so many great cities to have a grand prix. Miami is incredible as is Austin. I don't know about the next one but I'm not opposed to that.""
Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, who joined Hamilton in the round of driver press conferences, said he would also like to see three US races in future.
""I think Formula One is getting bigger and bigger in the last years thanks to the Netflix season here and I can definitely feel it and see it,"" he said, referring to the popular 'Drive to Survive' documentary series.
""It's great to be here and I would be very happy to have a third race here. And I agree with Lewis on Africa in general.""",['538_0'],"[""\nFormula One F1 - United States Grand Prix - Circuit of the Americas, Austin, Texas, U.S. - October 21, 2021  Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton during the press conference  FIA/Handout via REUTERS\n""]"
537,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/vettel-take-grid-penalty-austin-after-engine-change-2260821,Vettel to take grid penalty in Austin after engine change,"    Aston Martin's Sebastian Vettel will take a grid penalty at the U.S. Grand Prix after exceeding his engine allocation for the season.
The four-times Formula One world champion, a winner at Austin's Circuit of the Americas with Red Bull in 2013, has been struggling to score points recently with only one top-10 result in the last nine races.
""I think we are heading into, let’s say, a difficult weekend,"" the German told reporters. ""We are changing the engine and therefore we will have a penalty.
""We will see what we can do from where we start, and nevertheless, looking forward I think we can be strong here. How strong? We will see.""
Drivers are allowed three engines to last the season and any more than that triggers a grid drop. How many places depends on how many components of the power unit are changed.
Aston Martin use the same engines as champions Mercedes, whose seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton took a 10-place grid drop for the same reason at the previous race in Turkey.
The Circuit of the Americas offers at least plenty of overtaking opportunities.
""I think it's a good place to do it (take the penalty) and hopefully we'll have an entertaining Sunday afternoon and get back in the mix,"" said Vettel.

Mercedes' seven-times world champion Hamilton, six points behind Red Bull's Verstappen after 16 of 22 races, had little to say when asked at the U.S. Grand Prix on Thursday how the relationship had changed as the title fight intensifies.
""We have limited communication...some of the drivers hang more than others do. I wouldn't say I particularly hang closely with anybody here,"" said the Briton, who has battled wheel-to-wheel and collided with the Dutchman.
""Like last year, we will see each other at the track and we'll say hi. We'll do the same thing this year and it's no different to me personally.""
Verstappen has won seven races to Hamilton's five this year but Austin has been much more a Mercedes track than Red Bull in recent years.
Hamilton has won five of the eight races held in Austin and Mercedes have been on pole for the last six at the Circuit of the Americas.
This year could be a lot closer, however, and Hamilton - winner of a record 100 career races - recognised the next one in Mexico could also be tough.
Asked how important it was to win in Austin, Hamilton said it was important to win every race.
""It will be incredibly difficult. There will be moments where perhaps we can edge them out...I don't like to assume that Mexico is not going to be strong but they are usually very strong in Mexico,"" said the Briton.
""A lot can happen in these six races and so I think we just take it one race at a time and then give it everything we've got.""
Verstappen dismissed a suggestion he might be on a roll after seizing back the lead in Turkey two weeks ago, a race won comfortably enough by Hamilton's Finnish team mate Valtteri Bottas.
""We know that we still have a bit of work to do. We want to be faster,"" he said. ""The team result was good in Turkey, the overall performance wasn't amazing.""

535,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/melbournes-australian-grand-prix-not-going-anywhere-official-2261191,Melbourne's Australian Grand Prix 'not going anywhere': Official,"MELBOURNE: Australian Grand Prix boss Andrew Westacott has dismissed a report the Formula One race could end up in Sydney, saying Melbourne wants to keep it after its contract expires in 2025.
Australian broadcaster Seven Network said the New South Wales state government was having ""high level talks"" about a possible bid to snatch the race from Melbourne, without naming sources.
Organisers were forced to cancel the 2020 and 2021 races in Melbourne due to COVID-19 restrictions.
Westacott said the report was a surprise to him but organisers would fight to keep the race in Australia's second largest city.
""It's a highly sought-after event, but the Australian Grand Prix is not going anywhere as far as I'm concerned,"" he told Australian broadcaster Nine Network on Friday (Oct 22).
""We've got a strong relationship with Formula One, it's been built up over a quarter of a century of trust.""
The race was run in Adelaide from 1985-1995 before the Victoria state government did a deal with F1's former commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone to bring it to Melbourne.
""We're here until 2025, but we can never be complacent, we should never take our eye off the ball, as Adelaide showed in the 1990s,"" added Westacott.
""We want to keep the event here beyond 2025.""
Melbourne, which exited a near-three month lockdown on Friday, is scheduled to host the race in April, 2022.
Australia's immigration minister said this week foreign athletes not fully vaccinated for COVID-19 would be denied visas to enter the country, raising the prospect of high-profile withdrawals from the Australian Open tennis and other sports events.
Westacott said it was unlikely to be problematic for the Grand Prix.
""I'm confident F1 has a model that is based on a 100 per cent vaccination target. At the moment I think it's about 98 per cent across the travelling contingent because they've actually seen that it's a sound strategy for their own business continuity,"" he added.

Bottas, who was fastest in first practice for Sunday's U.S. Grand Prix at Austin's Circuit of the Americas, is now using  his sixth engine - three more than he is allowed for the season.
The Finn already had grid penalties at the Italian and Russian Grands Prix for exceeding his allocation.
Hamilton took a 10-place penalty at this month's Turkish Grand Prix for using a fourth engine and Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff would not rule out the seven times world champion having to do it again.
""I can't say whether we will be taking one (another penalty) and how are the percentages,"" the Austrian told reporters. ""But obviously the risk is still there.
""What is difficult to evaluate is do you want to pre-empt the situation and take another penalty, and take the hit, or do you want to really run it and then possibly risk a DNF (non-finish). 
""That is a discussion which is happening as we speak and we haven't come to the right answers yet.""
Hamilton is six points behind Red Bull's Max Verstappen in the championship with six races remaining. Austin has been one of their best tracks in recent years. 
Verstappen, 24, started at the back of the grid in Russia last month after taking his fourth Honda engine of the campaign and finished second.
Aston Martin, Williams and McLaren also use Mercedes engines, the most reliable in the past but now causing unexpected headaches.
Williams George Russell and Aston Martin's Sebastian Vettel are both set to start at the back of the grid in Austin after power unit changes.
""You see that we are suffering with reliability this year, we’re going onto the sixth engine ... and it’s not something that we choose to do,"" said Wolff.
""We are trying to really get on top of the problems and we haven’t understood fully ... We are hanging on for dear life in supplying all customers and that is not trivial.""
Red Bull boss Christian Horner said it was clear Mercedes had issues to resolve but their cars were still eye-catchingly fast, with Bottas almost a second a lap quicker than Verstappen in first practice.
""It's not usual for them in previous years to run their engines as hard as they have done this year in the first session,"" he told Sky Sports television. ""They are definitely running them harder."" 
Mercedes are 36 points clear of Red Bull in the cosntructors' standings but facing a major battle after seven years of success.

The 24-year-old Red Bull racer also gave the seven-times world champion, the most successful driver of all time, a single digit salute as the Mercedes accelerated away on a hot and humid Texas afternoon at Austin's Circuit of the Americas. 
""Ignore it, don't worry about it,"" his race engineer told him over the radio. Red Bull team boss Christian Horner joked Verstappen was simply pointing out who was number one in the standings.
Verstappen is six points clear of Hamilton with six rounds remaining and the battle is getting more intense with every race as the pendulum swings one way and then the other.
The Dutch youngster's Mexican team mate Sergio Perez was quickest in the second session, with a best lap of one minute 34.946 seconds.
""It was a good day, obviously it's going to be very tight,"" said Perez, whose role will be to support Verstappen unless circumstances fall his way.
""There's a lot to be done to try to improve the car,"" he added.
Verstappen, meanwhile, was frustrated by traffic and failed to set a proper flying lap. He ended up eighth in the session after third in the morning.
""The track's quite bumpy and to find the right compromise with the car hasn’t been the easiest so far,"" said Verstappen.
Jenson Button, Britain's 2009 world champion who is now a television pundit for Sky, wondered whether Hamilton was playing mind games.
""Obviously it did rattle Max a little bit, he was very upset on the radio,"" he said.
""It's been quite a fiery day for Max, to be fair. Not getting his lap. I think there's a bit of frustration building, with that incident he couldn't get his lap and then he had traffic in FP2 on his new tyres for two laps in a row.""   
McLaren's Lando Norris was second fastest and Hamilton, who  had his best lap deleted for exceeding track limits, third.
""Generally it's been a good day but still work to do,"" said the champion, who will be chasing a record-extending 101st career win on Sunday and sixth in nine races in Austin.
Mercedes had dominated the first session with Hamilton's Finnish team mate Valtteri Bottas 0.045 quicker than the  champion with Verstappen third but nearly a second off the Finn's pace.
Bottas, fourth in the afternoon session, will have a five-place grid penalty for Sunday's race after using his sixth engine of the campaign - three more than the rules allow.
Mercedes are favourites to win on Sunday after taking pole for the last six races there. Last year's round was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz were fourth and fifth in the morning, a boost for a team fighting McLaren for third.
The opening session was stopped after three minutes when Fernando Alonso stopped on track. The team said the Spaniard, who returned later, had done so as a precaution.
Haas's Mick Schumacher and Perez clashed on the bumpy track late in that session, with the Mexican unimpressed by the German rookie but later clearing things up. Stewards decided to take no further action.

Ferrari's Carlos Sainz was second on the timesheets, in 1:34.805, followed by Red Bull's championship leader Verstappen and McLaren's Lando Norris.
Seven times world champion Hamilton was sixth for Mercedes, with team mate Valtteri Bottas fifth, and 0.518 slower than Perez. Bottas has a five-place grid penalty for an engine change.
Hamilton and Verstappen went top in quick succession on the soft tyres but had the laps deleted for exceeding track limits. Verstappen's time was about a tenth quicker than the Briton's.
Verstappen leads Hamilton by six points in the standings with six races remaining.
Qualifying follows later on Saturday. Mercedes have been on pole position for the last six editions of the race at the Texan track.
Organisers were expecting some 140,000 fans to attend Sunday's race, after 120,000 on Friday and Saturday, in what will be the biggest crowd of the season.
Alpine's double world champion Fernando Alonso joined a growing list of drivers taking grid penalties for exceeding their power unit allocation after taking his fourth engine of the season.

""I think as a team we did a really good job ... the car was a lot better today.""
The front row will have fans rubbing their hands in anticipation of another thrilling wheel-to-wheel battle between the two on Sunday, providing they make it safely through the first corner.
They have already collided twice this season, at Silverstone and Monza.
""I hope we make it through turn one and we get a good race. I don't think it's all decided on turn one,"" said Hamilton, who has five wins in Texas among a record career tally of 100 victories.
The winner in Austin has always come from the front row, with Hamilton winning from second on the grid in the first race there in 2012 and then 2014 and 2015. 
Verstappen was, however, the first non-Mercedes driver to take the pole there since the start of the V6 turbo hybrid era in 2014.
He was ahead of Hamilton also in the first two phases of qualifying.
Red Bull team mate Sergio Perez had been eyeing the first pole position of his career after setting the pace in practice but ended up third on the grid.
The Mexican, almost a local and roared on by much of the 120,000 strong crowd, was fastest after the initial flying laps but he could not make it stick as first Hamilton and then Verstappen went quicker.
""I thought this could be my day, unfortunately I didn't put it all together at the end when it counted,"" he said.
Perez will be joined on the second row by Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, who was fastest in the opening phase of qualifying.
Hamilton's team mate Valtteri Bottas, winner from pole at the previous race in Turkey, qualified fourth but drops to ninth after a grid penalty for exceeding his season's engine allocation.
The third row will be Ferrari's Carlos Sainz and McLaren's Daniel Ricciardo, who had a nervous second phase when his first lap was deleted for going off track.
They were followed by the Australian's team mate Lando Norris and AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly.
There was also a moment of pitlane drama just before qualifying started, with Red Bull mechanics seen hurriedly strengthening the rear wings on both their cars.

Drivers need 40 points to race in Formula One but Chadwick now has the 25 that allow her to take part in Friday practice.
She already had 10 from finishing fourth in last year's Asian F3 championship.
Chadwick and compatriot Alice Powell had arrived in Texas level on 109 points, but with the latter leading 3-2 on wins.
The Williams F1 development driver won Saturday's first race to go 10 clear and on Sunday led every lap from pole position, with Powell finishing sixth.
The races in Texas were on the U.S. Grand Prix support programme and marked the first time the Formula Three level series had ventured outside Europe. All eight races this year were on the F1 undercard. 
Chadwick took her first title in 2019, with the series cancelled last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
W Series is aimed at helping women climb the motorsport ladder to Formula One, which has not had a female race driver since Italian Lella Lombardi in 1976.
Chadwick will be able to race in W Series again next year but only without being eligible for further super-licence points.

Verstappen soon started chafing over the radio that he had more pace and was first to pit on lap 11, as Red Bull went for the 'undercut' - a strategic bid to close the gap and get back in front when Hamilton pitted three laps later.
""Of course we lost out in the start so we had to try and do something else. The tyre wear is quite high around this track, we went aggressive and I was not sure it was going to work but the last few laps were fun,"" said Verstappen.
""A bit sideways through the high-speed corners but super happy to hang on.""
Verstappen made his second stop on lap 30 to hand Hamilton the lead again.
The Mercedes driver was told it was now ""target plus six"" and stayed out for another seven laps before pitting again and slotting in 8.58 seconds behind Verstappen with 18 laps to go but on fresher tyres.
""It's all about the last three laps,"" Hamilton was told over the radio but while he closed the gap to under a second, he could not get close enough to attempt a move.
""It was such a tough race. I got a good start, gave it absolutely everything but at the end of the day, they just had the upper hand this weekend and we couldn't really have asked for more,"" said the Briton.
NO WATER
Perez said his race was one he hoped never to repeat.
""I struggled massively. Since lap one I ran out of water, I couldn’t drink at all. I think by the middle of the second stint it was starting to get pretty difficult, losing strength. I think my toughest ever physically,"" he said.
Charles Leclerc was fourth for Ferrari, with Australian Daniel Ricciardo fifth for McLaren and Hamilton's team mate Valtteri Bottas sixth.
The points cut Mercedes lead in the constructors' standings to 23 points from 36.
Ferrari's Carlos Sainz was seventh, followed by McLaren's Lando Norris, AlphaTauri's Yuki Tsunoda and Aston Martin's Sebastian Vettel.
McLaren's lead over Ferrari in the battle for third was cut to 3.5 points.
AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly and Alpine's Esteban Ocon both retired with mechanical issues while Alpine Fernando Alonso stopped in the pits with a rear wing issue five laps from the end.     
The next race is on Nov. 7 in Mexico City, Perez's home race and a circuit expected to favour Red Bull.

527,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/every-f1-grand-prix-promoter-wants-sprint-race-says-brawn-2284071,"Every F1 grand prix promoter wants a sprint race, says Brawn","LONDON :     Every Formula One grand prix promoter wants to hold a sprint race but only six are likely next season after the experiment of three this year, F1's motorsport head Ross Brawn said on Monday.
Next year's F1 calendar is due to feature a record 23 rounds.
Britain's Silverstone, Italy's Monza and Brazil's Interlagos were the circuits chosen to try the format this year and Brawn, speaking to reporters by video conference, did not say which would get the nod in 2022.
Further talks with teams and stakeholders will be held after this month's Brazilian Grand Prix, the final stage of the evaluation process. 
""We've in principle agreed with the teams that we will look toward six (sprint) events for next year,"" said Brawn. ""Our view is that we should take some progressive steps for next year but not radical steps.
""That's partly because we have the new car coming along and everyone needs to settle down with the new car ... we need to see the impact of the new car.""
Formula One is undergoing major changes next year with larger tyres and a rules overhaul aimed at making overtaking easier and racing closer and more entertaining.
The sprint format features qualifying brought forward to the  Friday, after one practice session, for a Saturday 100km race that then decides the starting grid for Sunday's main event.
SEVERAL FACTORS
""I think it’s clear that every promoter we have would like to have a sprint,"" said Brawn, who did not rule out the format  eventually being used at a majority of grands prix.
""There’s a number of factors we’ve got to take into consideration. One is the spread through the year. How do we spread these events through the year?
""It’s probably not something we’d want to have at the first race, probably not something we want at the last race ... it would be nice to have a variety (of circuits).""
Brawn has said in the past that Monaco, a tight and twisty street circuit where overtaking is extremely difficult, would be unsuited to the format and he said on Monday it would be ""probably bottom of the list.
""It's probably the most challenging circuit to have a sprint ... but never say never,"" he added.
Points have been awarded this season for the top three drivers in the sprint, in a 3-2-1 system, but Brawn said that could be expanded next year to provide more of an incentive through the field.
He said the original proposal had been for the sprint to have around a third of the points on offer in the main race and that could happen in 2022.
""We think that will be the starting point for the discussion,"" he explained. 
""Something around that order so it's significant enough to be worth going for, it goes far enough down for people in lower positions to still want to fight for it but not of a number that has an over-influence on the championship.""

The subject has been much debated after a trial of the sprint format this season at three grands prix, with six under discussion for 2022.
Pole position for regular races is decided in qualifying on Saturday, with the fastest lap in the final phase taking the top slot.
Under the sprint format, qualifying is on Friday and sets the grid for a 100km Saturday race whose winner starts Sunday's main event from pole position.
""It’s been a consistent comment amongst fans and media and drivers that the person who does the fastest single lap with low fuel in that competition is the pole position holder,"" Brawn told reporters on Monday.
""I guess we hadn’t really considered that, if I'm honest, when we set out this new format.
""Personally I would like to see a reversion to that being pole position but these things are decided with the (governing) FIA and the teams.
""There is broad opinion that Friday should be (counted as) pole position for the sprint weekends, so that's something I would hope we can get through for next year ... I'm optimistic on that one.""
Four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel, who has 57 career poles and ranks fourth in the all-time lists, was critical of the statistics recording a race win as a pole position when it was tried out for the first time at Silverstone in July.
So too was retired 2016 world champion Nico Rosberg, who achieved 30 poles.
""Pole 100 per cent has to go to the fastest guy in qualifying. The sprint race winner should not be awarded pole position. That will totally cannibalise the historic F1 statistics,"" Rosberg said at the time on Twitter.",['526_0'],['\nFormula One Managing Director of Motorsports Ross Brawn walks at the Shanghai International Circuit ahead of the Chinese F1 Grand Prix.

Andretti - a former IndyCar champion, F1 racer and son of 1978 Formula One world champion Mario - had been in advanced talks with Sauber ahead of last month's US Grand Prix in Austin.
""I'd just like to put an end to some of these rumours that the deal fell through because of financial reasons,"" the Andretti Autosport boss told reporters after announcing rookie Devlin DeFrancesco as his latest IndyCar signing.
""That couldn't be further from the truth. It had nothing to do with that.
""It basically came down to control issues in the final hours of the negotiations. That's what killed the deal,"" said the American, who has long wanted to add a Formula One team to his motorsport activities.
Swiss-based Sauber were bought by investment firm Longbow Finance in 2016, with Islero Investments taking control of Sauber Holdings in 2018. Islero are linked to Swedish billionaire Finn Rausing.
Andretti has interests in IndyCar, the electric Formula E and Extreme E series as well as sportscars.

Miami in May will be the second U.S. round, joining Austin, Texas, whose race last month reported a record three-day crowd of 400,000 with a Sunday attendance of 140,000.
The popularity of the Netflix F1 documentary series ""Drive to Survive"" is credited with a big rise in the sport's popularity in the United States.
Greg Maffei, president and CEO of commercial rights holder Liberty Media, told analysts on a third quarter earnings call that some 70per cent of the crowd in Austin had been attending their first grand prix.
""We are excited to have our second race in the U.S. and welcome the Miami GP in May. Demand is high: 275,000 people pre-registered to purchase tickets as compared to a planned capacity of around 80,000,"" he said.
Grandstand tickets sold out on the first day, with 1,800 people paying a US$5,000 deposit for luxury hospitality.
The Formula One Group as a whole reported a US$68 million profit in the third quarter, compared to a US$115 million loss in the same period in 2020 when races were being held behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Seven races took place in Q3 2021 compared to 10 in the same three-month period of 2020. 
Total Formula One Group revenues rose to US$668 million from a previous US$597.
""Formula One is firing on all cylinders and producing results on the track, for our fans and partners and our investors,"" said chief executive Stefano Domenicali.

Red Bull's Max Verstappen leads Mercedes' seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton by 12 points ahead of Sunday's Mexico City Grand Prix, the 18th of 22 races this season.

523,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/perez-says-everyone-red-bull-wants-him-win-mexico-2292391,Perez says everyone at Red Bull wants him to win in Mexico,"Sergio Perez said he was sure Red Bull want him to win his home Mexico City Grand Prix after facing questions on Thursday (Nov 4) about whether they would let him beat championship-leading team mate Max Verstappen.
Verstappen is 12 points clear of Mercedes' seven-times Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton with five races remaining, including Sunday's, in one of the closest title battles in years.
Asked what might happen if he were leading with Verstappen in second place, and whether he would move aside, Perez said it would be a great problem to have.
""It always depends on the situation,"" he added. ""Most of the decisions are normally taken during the race, during the heat of the event.
""I think that depending on the circumstances we'll see. But I'm pretty sure that the whole team, Red Bull, everyone wants me to win this weekend ... I'm sure I have full support from everyone in my team.""
The only Mexican on the starting grid is out of title contention but has won twice in the past year.
He has also stood on the podium in his last two races and has never been closer to his dream of becoming the first Mexican to win at home.
Red Bull have won nine races this season, Verstappen taking eight of them with Perez triumphant in Azerbaijan in June after the Dutch 24-year-old crashed out with a tyre failure while leading.
Hamilton said he considered the high-altitude Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez ""a Red Bull track"", even if Mercedes could still be strong.
McLaren's Australian Daniel Ricciardo, Verstappen's former Red Bull team mate who sat alongside Perez for the media call, gave the Mexican his support.
""I want you to win as well,"" he told him.
Ricciardo said he would not want to move aside for a team mate at his home race in Melbourne if he was in with a chance of victory.
""Right now, my answer's no. I would not,"" he said. ""If it was the last race of the season and that position swap literally meant the world title or not, then maybe that's a more complex decision-making process.
""But a home win, that's like the thing that you dream of as a kid. And if obviously you've earned it on track then I feel like it should be yours for the taking.""
Four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel, who won his titles with Red Bull between 2010-13 and now drives for Aston Martin, felt Perez should be allowed to win if given the chance.
""Even if maybe the situation is logically very easy to explain, I still think it's bad and I would be in favour of not having any team orders, ever,"" said the German of the likelihood of Red Bull telling Perez to cede position.
""I think it's just dull. Nobody likes it. If Checo (Perez) happens to be ahead, then Checo should stay ahead.
""But I can also see if that's not happening and he will have to let Max by, then yeah. Valtteri (Bottas, Hamilton's team mate) has been in that position and it's not nice.""",['523_0'],"[""\nRed Bull's Sergio Perez during a press conference on Nov 4, 2021. (Photo: Reuters/Edgard Garrido)\n""]"

The 36-year-old Mercedes driver is chasing a record eighth championship but is 12 points adrift of Dutch youngster Verstappen with five rounds remaining, including Sunday's (Nov 7) in Mexico City.
The two have collided twice this season and Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff recently raised the spectre of the 1989 and 1990 clashes between Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost as well as the 1997 one between Michael Schumacher and Jacques Villeneuve.
""If it was to come to the scenario of the last race in Abu Dhabi and they were to be racing each other for the title, whoever is in front is absolutely going to try to do the same as in the Senna-Prost years,"" the Austrian told the Daily Mail.
""If you are racing for the championship and you see it fading away because the other guy is overtaking you, what tool have you got other than the one that makes sure he can't overtake?
""We've seen it with Schumacher and Villeneuve, we saw it with Senna and Prost twice.""
Hamilton, whose team have won the last seven drivers' and constructors' crowns, made clear that was not how he went about his business.
""We've never won a championship in that way. I have never won a championship in that way, and would never want to,"" the Briton told reporters at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez.
""I'm here to win in the right way, and that's through sheer skill and determination and hard work.""
Hamilton, the most successful driver in the history of the sport with 100 career wins and 101 pole positions, said he would take defeat in the same way.
""I always want to win it the right way,"" he said. ""And if you're going to lose it, you lose it the right way also. With dignity and knowing that you've given it your all and you've done things the right way.
""All you can do is give it your all and work as hard as you can with the team. If it doesn't work out, then you live to fight another day.""
Verstappen, who has won eight times this season to Hamilton's five, said he would race hard and ""always try to keep it clean"".
""I don't really think about previous historic fights between two drivers, what they have done,"" added the 24-year-old, whose father Jos was once a team mate of seven times champion Schumacher.
""It is the past. I just focus on what I have to do on track of course and that's to try and do the best I can.""",['522_0'],"[""\nMercedes' Lewis Hamilton during a press conference on Nov 4, 2021. (Photo: Reuters/Edgard Garrido)\n""]"

Hamilton tested positive for the coronavirus last December and had to miss the Sakhir Grand Prix in Bahrain, which came after the Mercedes driver had sealed his record-equalling seventh championship.
Five other drivers, out of 20, have tested positive since the start of the pandemic.
""If I slide in the shower and I break my neck it’s the same story, isn’t it?"" Red Bull's Verstappen told reporters ahead of Sunday's Mexico City Grand Prix when asked whether he was taking any extra precautions.
""If I go out in Monaco and I slip while walking and I break my leg, I mean, it’s also not great,"" added the 24-year-old, who leads Hamilton by 12 points with five races remaining.
""I don’t really think about these things. I just keep on doing and living my life like I have been in the last two years already, of course, with COVID. Just continue doing what I have been doing.""
Formula 1 arrives in Mexico from the US Grand Prix in Texas and heads next to Brazil before a closing run of three races in the Middle East.
COVID-19 has killed over 600,000 people in Brazil, the second-highest death toll in the world behind only the United States. Mexico has the fourth highest.
Deaths and infections have, however, declined across the Americas for the eighth consecutive week, according to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).
Formula One has travelled further afield this season, after a 2020 campaign in Europe and the Middle East, and welcomed large crowds again after a year behind closed doors.
The teams operate inside a protective 'bubble' but the paddock has opened up more.
Hamilton said he kept the group around him to a small number of people, and was careful where he went, but felt most people outside the sport took it less seriously.
""I’ve seen footballers just recently, they didn’t care. I read that they didn’t really put too much focus on it,"" he said. ""And if they miss a game, it doesn’t make a huge difference. It’s a bit different here.
""We’re allowing fans to come in that aren’t tested and also now I think all the photographers are coming in,"" added the Briton.
""I know it’s opening it up more, but I anticipate they’ll need to make some changes soon because it’s a tough bubble to keep.""",['521_0'],"[""\nFILE PHOTO: Formula One F1 - Mexico Grand Prix - Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, Mexico City, Mexico - November 4, 2021 Red Bull's Max Verstappen during the press conference Pool via REUTERS/Edgard Garrido\n""]"

Verstappen set a best time of one minute 17.301 seconds in the afternoon at the high-altitude Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, with seven-times world champion Hamilton third quickest and 0.509 slower.
Valtteri Bottas had led Hamilton in a Mercedes one-two in the morning but ended up 0.424 slower than Verstappen after lunch.
Local hero Sergio Perez, who spun and hit the wall in first practice, was fourth in both sessions for Red Bull.
Verstappen leads Hamilton, who was reprimanded after the first session for a track infringement, by 12 points with five races remaining.
On a track that started dirty but then cleaned up and got faster, with the circuit not hosting a grand prix last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Dutch 24-year-old lived up to his favourite tag.
""It was quite a good day, of course always trying to improve the car,"" said Verstappen. ""It seemed like the car's working quite well, a few things to look at but pretty good.
""We have a good feeling...it's a positive start to the weekend."" 
Red Bull team boss Christian Horner said both his drivers were showing a reasonable performance in the short and long runs.
""I think Mercedes have still got a bit in the pocket so I don't think we've seen the full potential yet,"" he added.
""We've seen all year that there's been less than a tenth between the cars, and we expect that to be the case tomorrow.""
Hamilton said there had been no major issues and he had no real concerns.
""I think we were giving it absolutely everything we've got and I think they were just quicker than us at the moment,"" he said.
""We're lacking downforce which is probably why we have the half second difference between us.""        
Alpha Tauri's Pierre Gasly was fifth fastest and Ferrari's Carlos Sainz sixth in the morning with the positions reversed in session two, when Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was seventh and AlphaTauri's Yuki Tsunoda eighth.
McLaren, battling Ferrari for third place overall, had a difficult start at the high-altitude circuit with Australian Daniel Ricciardo 14th and Britain's Lando Norris 15th in the morning.
Norris was 12th and Ricciardo 15th in the afternoon, with the Australian ending the session early due to a gearbox problem.
""Not an easy session for us, drivers really struggling with the balance of the car and not getting the laps in, "" said team boss Andreas Seidl. ""We have work to do.

No Mexican driver has ever won a home grand prix but Perez has a winning car and has been on the podium in his last two races.
He is not in contention for the title, however, while team mate Max Verstappen is top of the standings with a 12-point advantage over Mercedes' seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton and five races remaining.
Verstappen has eight wins this year to Perez's one.
Asked whether he would tell Perez to let Verstappen overtake if the Mexican was leading with the Dutch driver second, Horner said it was a tough call.
""Our main objective is to win both championships and both drivers know the task involved to achieve that,"" he told reporters.
""You can't rule it (team orders) out, you can't rule it in. Our preference would be, if Checo were in that position, for him to win his home race. There is no bigger result for any home driver.
""But as a team we have to keep an eye on both of these championships and know what’s at stake and this race, like any other, has the same amount of points attributable to it and therefore we treat it like any other race.""
Perez has played a supporting role to Verstappen this season, moving aside where required, but it would be a big ask  with a huge crowd expecting to cheer on a home hero whose face is on advertising billboards across the capital.
Mercedes have won the past seven drivers' and constructors' championships and are still 23 points clear of Red Bull in the latter competition.
""Team orders are part of the sport being a team sport,"" continued Horner.
""The drivers are one element of the team, their contract is with the team, and the constructors’ championship... that's where the money is paid out.
""We operate as a team and that’s why team orders sometimes are necessary for the best interest of the sport. I’ve got no doubt you’ll see more and more of that at the sharp end of this championship over the remaining five races,"" he said.
Horner also rejected a suggestion from Mercedes boss Toto Wolff that the title could be decided by a collision between the two contenders, as in the past between Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost.
""I was disappointed to read the comments,"" he said. ""We want a really fair fight between now and the end of the championship. I think any driver would want to win the championship on track.
""Nobody wants to see a championship decided in a gravel trap.""

The pair also clashed ahead of the British Grand Prix, where  Mercedes' seven-time world champion Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen collided, with Horner labelling Wolff a ""control freak"" who should keep his mouth shut.
Pantomime, a popular British family entertainment around Christmas with a blend of slapstick musical comedy and topical jokes, usually features a man in drag performing the role of an older ""dame"".
""I was quite flattered actually, being called a protagonist,"" Horner told reporters at the Mexico City Grand Prix where Verstappen is seeking to extend a 12-point lead over Hamilton with five races remaining. 
""I think you also need an antagonist to have a protagonist. One could say that perhaps Toto fulfils that role pretty well - if it were a pantomime then the pantomime dame role might suit him.""
Horner said he took Wolff's comments with a pinch of salt as part of an all-out battle between teams, drivers and engine manufacturers.
Mercedes have won the last seven drivers' and constructors' titles, their unprecedented success following a four-year run by Red Bull. Hamilton is going for a record eighth crown, while Verstappen is chasing his first.
Horner said what happened off track was all noise but could not resist a little dig as he complimented his rival for Mercedes' achievements.
""I have no issue with Toto. I think he has done a great job there in a team he inherited,"" he said, alluding to the fact that Wolff arrived at a team that had won championships with predecessor Ross Brawn.
""Toto likes to throw in a comment here or there and that’s part of the needle, that’s part of the sport. He’s got a lot at stake.
""Formula One is a competition and as the pressure builds you see people react to pressure in different ways. We are at the business end of that championship now, and you can feel the tension and that will only grow the longer this goes on.
""If Toto wants to make a comment or two, I’m fine with that. It’s pantomime season coming up anyway.""

The 31-year-old home hero, who has never stood on the podium in Mexico, posted a best effort of one minute 17.024 seconds at the high altitude Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez with Verstappen 0.193 slower.
The crowd gave a huge roar at Perez's time which his team mate, struggling for grip, did not try and beat in the dying seconds.
Seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton, 12 points adrift of Verstappen in the championship with five races remaining, was third fastest for Mercedes but 0.651 off Perez's pace. Team mate Valtteri Bottas was fourth.
""Six and a half tenths?,"" said a disbelieving Hamilton over the radio after being told of the gap.  
Carlos Sainz was fifth fastest for Ferrari, whose chances of overtaking McLaren for third place overall were boosted by Lando Norris taking a new engine that sends him to the back of the field for exceeding his season's allowance.
The Briton can still provide a useful aerodynamic tow for Australian team mate Daniel Ricciardo in Saturday's later qualifying.
Alpine's Esteban Ocon, AlphaTauri's Yuki Tsunoda and Aston Martin's Lance Stroll also have similar penalties while Williams' George Russell drops five for replacing his car's gearbox.
An oil spill from earlier support races made the track slippery in the stadium sector, with cement dust laid down over it and drivers waiting for it to settle before starting the session.

The outcome marked an extraordinary turnaround for Mercedes at a high-altitude circuit expected to favour Red Bull, whose Formula One championship leader Max Verstappen will start in third place.
Verstappen, 12 points ahead of Hamilton with five races remaining, had been half a second faster than Hamilton in   Friday practice.
He was joined on the second row by team mate Sergio Perez,  whose fastest time in final practice had triggered hopes of a  first career pole at his home race.
Bottas set his time of one minute 15.875 seconds with his first flying lap of the final session at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez and it stood, with Hamilton 0.145 behind after their final efforts.
""I definitely surprised myself,"" said the Finn, whose 19th career pole and third of the season earned him a replica of the helmet worn by late Argentine great Juan Manuel Fangio 70 years ago.
Hamilton, who can expect his team mate to play a supportive role on Sunday, agreed it was an unexpected twist to the afternoon with Mercedes fastest in all three phases of qualifying.
""We didn't think we had the pace this weekend. So to lock out the front row is pretty special,"" said the Briton, a two times winner in Mexico.
""They (Red Bull) were like six tenths ahead at one stage and then four tenths ahead, but whatever happened once we got to qualifying we had better pace. I'm just as shocked as everyone but we'll take it.""
TERRIBLE GRIP 
Verstappen struggled to get the tyres to work, with a lack of grip on his first flying lap and then the distraction of AlphaTauri's Yuki Tsunoda and Perez going wide ahead of him during his second lap.
""We were just really slow and terrible grip in Q3,"" said the Dutch driver, whose best lap was 0.350 slower than Bottas. ""We just had a terrible qualifying.""
The Dutch driver was heard over the radio saying ""unbelievable, such a dumb idiot"" in reference to another driver and the Red Bull team boss told Sky Sports television that Verstappen had been ""Tsunoda-ed"".
AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly qualified fifth.
Australian Daniel Ricciardo was seventh and caught in a Ferrari sandwich, with Carlos Sainz sixth and Charles Leclerc eighth.
Ferrari and McLaren are fighting a tight battle for third overall, with the Italian team a mere 3.5 points behind their rivals.
Tsunoda was ninth but will drop to the back due to an engine penalty, as will McLaren's Lando Norris in 10th. That lifted Aston Martin's Sebastian Vettel and Alfa Romeo's Kimi Raikkonen to the last top 10 slots.   
The first phase suffered a lengthy stoppage for repairs to the barrier after Aston Martin's Lance Stroll crashed out of the final corner with only seven drivers having set a time.
Stroll had been due to start at the back of the field anyway due to an engine change that exceeded his allocation for the season.
""I was a little bit too wide. It (the track) was a bit dirty out there and I lost it,"" said the Canadian after a trip to the medical centre for precautionary checks following the 12G impact.
Alpine's double world champion Fernando Alonso was the big casualty of that session, failing to make the cut in 16th place after George Russell sent his Williams through to the second phase.
The Spaniard will start 12th after grid penalties are applied to others.

The Finn hoped, however, that he might yet have the chance to win.
""I need to enjoy this pole for a bit but then switch my mind for tomorrow,"" Bottas told Sky Sports television after leading seven-times world champion team mate Hamilton in a qualifying one-two at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez.
""You never know what the race situation will be. I still am 100per cent sure that there could be a circumstance where I could still win the race and I believe in that and I hope for that,"" he continued. 
""But if not then I will support Lewis and get the maximum points for us as a team.""
Hamilton is 12 points behind Red Bull's championship leader Max Verstappen, with five races remaining, and Bottas has played a supporting role already this season with Mercedes 23 points ahead in the constructors' standings.
The Finn is leaving the team for Alfa Romeo at the end of the season.
Mexico City had been considered a Red Bull track but qualifying turned that notion on its head and gave Hamilton a real chance of regaining the momentum after defeat in Texas two weeks ago.
That Austin circuit had been supposed to play to Mercedes' strengths.
""Valtteri did an amazing job today and we are both, and I think probably everybody in the team, shocked that we own the front row because they (Red Bull) have been quicker than us all weekend,"" said Hamilton. ""It was a real shock.
Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff had revealed that the team strategists had been working on the basis of the drivers starting third and fourth on the grid. Qualifying gave them a lot more to think about.
""Things are just completely different,"" said Hamilton.
""Last night there would have been simulations of what we do from third or fourth. It was not on the table to get (the front row)...there was no way we were going to get pole.
""To have done so is great work from the team.""

The driver for AlphaTauri, the sister team of Red Bull Racing, was accused of wrecking the final flying laps of Verstappen and Mexican Sergio Perez at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez.
The Japanese already had an engine penalty that was going to demote him to the back of the grid but reached the final phase of qualifying with the aim of helping team mate Pierre Gasly with an aerodynamic tow.
Tsunoda, running slowly by then, went off track to get out of the way as Perez attempted his final flying lap, the Honda protege kicking up dust that then distracted the Mexican.
Verstappen, following behind, was also forced to slow.
The Dutch driver, who qualified third and leads Mercedes Lewis Hamilton by 12 points with five races remaining, exclaimed over the team radio: ""Unbelievable, such a dumb idiot"".
""I think we got Tsunoda-ed,"" Red Bull team boss Christian Horner told Sky Sports television.
""Both drivers were up on their last lap. Max was up two and a half tenths and I think Checo (Perez) was just under two tenths up and I don’t understand why he (Tsunoda) was just cruising around at that part of the circuit.
""So it’s disappointing because it affected both the drivers. They are both pretty annoyed.""
Verstappen, who will line up behind the Mercedes pair of Valtteri Bottas and Hamilton, said he had been on for a good lap time.
""There were two guys going off so I thought there was going to be a yellow flag, so I backed out and the lap was of course destroyed,"" he said.
Perez, the home hero, said Tsunoda going off at turn 11 had hurt his lap.
""He wasn’t a distraction it was that I was too close to him and it forced me to brake. Once I did that I lost my downforce and I think I got a lot of dirty air, lost the car unfortunately and lost my lap,"" he said.

Seven-times world champion Hamilton was second for Mercedes, holding off Red Bull's Sergio Perez who became the first Mexican to stand on his home podium at a jubilant Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez.
Red Bull closed the gap to champions Mercedes in the constructors' standings to one point.
""It's still a long way to go but it's of course looking good, but also it can turn around very quickly,"" said Verstappen, 24, of his big step forward in the championship battle.
Verstappen took the chequered flag 16.555 seconds clear of Hamilton to seal his ninth victory of the season, third in Mexico and 19th of his career.
The Dutchman seized the lead into the first corner from third on the grid, going three abreast with the two Mercedes and timing his braking to perfection, in what turned out to be the decisive moment of the race.
""I kept it on the track, came from third to first and that was basically what made my race because I could just focus on myself, and we had incredible pace in the car,"" he said.
Verstappen then gave Hamilton no chance to hit back once the safety car, deployed after collisions further back, was out of the way.  
Hamilton, the most successful driver of all time with 100 career wins, said he gave it everything after being chased closely by Perez over the last 10 laps.
""I feel like I maximised it with what I have,"" said the Briton.
""We've got four races to go and we just have to keep pushing."" 
MEXICAN FIESTA
Perez was hoisted high on the shoulders of his mechanics as he waved the Mexican flag to salute the crowd before the podium ceremony.
""Of course I wanted more, I wanted to get a one-two for the team but I didn't have a single chance to get through,"" he said after his third podium in a row after third places in Texas and Turkey.
""If I had a small chance I would have gone for it,"" added the 31-year-old, who also became the first Mexican to lead his home race after Verstappen and Hamilton had pitted.
The safety car was deployed until lap four after a collision at the start between Haas' Mick Schumacher and AlphaTauri's Yuki Tsunoda, while McLaren's Daniel Ricciardo tagged the back of Valtteri Bottas's Mercedes and lost his front wing.
Bottas, who had taken a surprise pole position on Saturday, was spun around and dropped to 18th place after an immediate pitstop.
The Finn ended up 15th but pitted for fresh tyres to snatch the fastest lap from Verstappen at the end, denying the Dutchman a precious bonus point without it coming to Mercedes since he was outside the top 10.
""You have to congratulate Red Bull because the pace was just on another level,"" said Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff. ""I don't think we could have won the race even if we had stayed ahead in the first corner."" 
AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly was fourth with Ferrari duo Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz fifth and sixth to lift the  Italian team ahead of McLaren and into third place in the constructors' standings.
Sebastian Vettel was seventh for Aston Martin, with fellow champions Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso eighth and ninth for Alfa Romeo and Alpine respectively. Lando Norris took the final point for McLaren.

With four races remaining, the 24-year-old Dutch driver surged 19 points clear of Mercedes seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton.
Running three abreast on the long run down to the first corner, Verstappen displayed precision and nerves of steel as he braked late and took the two Mercedes cars around the outside to seize the lead.
""I knew the start was going to be really important and we went three wide towards turn one and it was all about who was going to brake the latest,"" said the 24-year-old, who started third on the grid.
""Basically that made my race because after that I could just do my own pace and control it from there.
""There was not much they could do. They were already side by side and I just went three wide,"" added Verstappen, who now has nine wins for the season to Hamilton's five.
He took the chequered flag a hefty 16.555 seconds clear of Hamilton, who was only 1.197 seconds ahead of Red Bull's local hero Sergio Perez and might have lost a place had they gone another lap.
The points haul left resurgent Red Bull just one point behind defending champions Mercedes in the constructors' standings.
They would have been equal had Valtteri Bottas not snatched the fastest lap from Verstappen right at the end, denying Red Bull the bonus point.
""Today's been a massive day, a fantastic drive by Max. The most important part was the start. He nailed the start,"" said team boss Christian Horner.
""I thought Max had missed his braking because he was so late on the brakes at turn one but he made it stick and from there really controlled the race. It was a very straightforward race for him.""
Despite the points gain, Verstappen was still refusing to get carried away.
""There is a long way to go. It’s of course looking good but also it can turn around very quickly but I’m looking forward to Brazil (the next race),"" he said. ""I have also very good memories there.""

The 36-year-old Briton had started on the front row of the grid, only for his hopes of victory to be dashed in the opening seconds as Verstappen seized the lead and then pulled away to win.
""Their car was far superior this weekend and there was nothing we really could do about it,"" Hamilton said after finishing second, the gap between him and his Dutch rival extended to 19 points.
The champion said he gave all he had, holding off Red Bull's Sergio Perez at the finish with the Mexican chasing a team one-two.
Giving everything was still not enough, however, on a day when team mate Valtteri Bottas started on pole position but was hit and spun on the opening lap, ending up out of the points.
""I naturally feel I need to be winning every race, because we need those extra points, not to lose those points, to try and regain, that was the goal going into the last race and the race before that and before that and here this weekend,"" said Hamilton.
""But ... they’re just too quick. So (we were) giving it absolutely everything we’ve got but unfortunately it’s not enough at the moment to compete with them.""
Verstappen has now won nine races to Hamilton's five and the next, in Brazil, should also play to his car's strengths before three final races in the Middle East.
Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said it had been a question of damage limitation for Hamilton in the championship race, and hailed the Briton for driving ""a brilliant race with the equipment he was given"".
""You have to congratulate Red Bull because the pace was just on another level. I don't think we could have won the race even if we would have stayed ahead in the first corner,"" said the Austrian.
""As for the constructors' (battle), Valtteri spinning out at turn was just very painful.

From starting the race 3.5 points adrift, the Italian team moved 13.5 clear of their British rivals and with high hopes of making the advantage stick.
It was the third race in a row that Ferrari had outscored McLaren, who enjoyed a points bonanza when they won the Italian Grand Prix one-two at Monza in September. 
""We did what we wanted, which was to outscore McLaren by a fair bit,"" said Spaniard Carlos Sainz, who finished sixth with team mate Charles Leclerc fifth.
""We had a good opportunity this weekend, we managed it and now we go into the last four races of the season with the upper hand in the championship.
""It’s going to be tight, I think there’s going to be tracks where they (McLaren) are going to have the quicker car but now we need to focus to keep working well as a team like we did today, and keep going forward.""
Mercedes and Red Bull are far ahead in the standings but third marks a big improvement for Ferrari, who suffered their worst season in 40 years in 2020 when they ended the campaign sixth overall. 
Team boss Mattia Binotto said before the start of this season that third place was the minimum objective.
Formula One's oldest and most successful team have not won a race since the Singapore Grand Prix in September 2019. Their last title was in 2008, when they won the constructors' crown.
McLaren scored only one point on Sunday with Lando Norris finishing 10th.

The 31-year-old Red Bull driver, who was looking for a job  only a year ago, also wrote history as the first Mexican to lead at home before finishing third in a race won by team mate Max Verstappen.
With 138,435 fans packed into Mexico City's Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, and mostly there for the home hero, 'Checo'  celebrated his third podium in three races - a first in his career.
""It’s an unbelievable day,"" said the Mexican after chasing Mercedes' seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton to the chequered flag.
""Being on the podium at your home Grand Prix is something very special. Obviously I wanted more, I wanted to win the race and obviously to finish one-two for the team would have been amazing, you know.
""We are such competitive persons that if we finish third, we really, really don’t enjoy it but today is one of those days that I must enjoy because of the crowd and seeing so many people so happy.""
Perez's face has been on advertising hoardings around the city, the man of the moment on his return as a winner for the first time and to a circuit that was unable to host a grand prix last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
A year ago he was talking about taking a sabbatical after being told by Racing Point, now Aston Martin, that his seat was going to four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel and running out of alternatives.
Then he won in Bahrain last December and was signed by Red Bull who needed an experienced and consistent driver to boost their challenge for the title and serve as a loyal sidekick to Verstappen.
Winning in Azerbaijan in June, after Verstappen had crashed out while leading, Perez has stepped up just when Red Bull most needed it.
The Mexican had never previously finished higher than seventh at home but he had also never had a car capable of winning. 
""Checo has found his form in the last three or four races and that's just presenting us with so many more options,"" commented team boss Christian Horner, whose team are now only a point behind Mercedes.
""He's totally in tune with that, he's asking all the questions from the car as well and I have to say it's probably one of the best if not the best team spirit we've ever had in this team.""

The Dutch 24-year-old is by no means an unstoppable force, with two retirements already this year, but Sunday's Mexico City Grand Prix victory sent him 19 points clear of Mercedes' seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton with four races remaining.
Another win in Brazil next weekend - which is a new format sprint event with three extra points available on Saturday in addition to 26 on Sunday - would put him more than a race victory clear.
It would also open up the real possibility that the title battle will not go down to the wire as many people have supposed.
Verstappen has outscored Hamilton in the last three races, winning the most recent two, and won four of seven races since the end of the August break - when Hamilton led the championship.
Over those same seven races, the Red Bull driver has scored 27 points more than Hamilton but he is still taking it one race at a time.
""I don’t believe in momentum,"" he said after his win on Sunday at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez when asked whether he felt it was going his way now.
""Every single race we have to try and nail the details and we didn’t do that yesterday (in qualifying) so, you know, things can go wrong very quickly, or can go right. So it’s going to be really tight and exciting to the end.
""This has been always a track really good for us, I expect Brazil not to be like it was today.""
The 2021 season should come with a warning to expect the unexpected, and one retirement on either side could change everything.
Verstappen and Red Bull appear to have the upper hand for the time being, even if Mercedes showed they are no longer as vulnerable at high-altitude tracks as in the past.
Damon Hill, the 1996 world champion, suggested on Sunday to Red Bull boss Christian Horner that Verstappen had at least two fingers on the title trophy now.
Jenson Button, a fellow Sky television pundit and the 2009 world champion, felt Verstappen's bold first corner swoop to pass Hamilton and Mercedes pole-sitter Valtteri Bottas could prove to be a defining moment.
Horner was, as ever, wary of tempting fate.
""There's still 107 points available,"" he told reporters. ""There's a long way and the reliability is going to play a crucial role, maximising every weekend, the strategy and pitstops.""",['506_0'],"[""\nRed Bull's Max Verstappen celebrates after winning the race with Antonio Perez,  father of third placed Red Bull's Sergio Perez.

Horner told Sky television that his drivers Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez had been ""Tsunodered"" in qualifying after their final flying laps were affected by the Japanese going off track and kicking up dust ahead of them.
Honda-backed Tsunoda, 21, is also part of the Red Bull stable of drivers with the energy drink brand owning AlphaTauri as well as their main team.
The comment kicked up a controversy on social media, with critics accusing Red Bull of failing to nurture and protect junior talent.
""Unfortunately social media has a habit of picking on certain lines and then exploiting them,"" Horner told reporters when questioned about his words.
""It would be a pretty boring world if you are unable to comment on the performance of a driver.""
Verstappen won Sunday's race from third on the grid, passing both Mercedes cars around the outside at the start, to go 19 points clear of Mercedes' seven times champion Lewis Hamilton, with Perez third.
Horner was in far better spirits on Sunday afternoon than he had been on Saturday and had time to reconsider his view of qualifying.

504,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/stewart-help-take-fangios-remains-new-resting-place-2299601,Stewart to help take Fangio's remains to new resting place,"Triple world champion Jackie Stewart will pay tribute to Formula One great Juan Manuel Fangio on Wednesday when the Argentine's last remains are moved to a new resting place in a museum alongside his cars.
This year marks the 70th anniversary of the first of Fangio's five world championships with four different constructors.
""I'm carrying his remains to his racing car collection. He was the greatest driver of all time,"" Stewart said at the weekend's Mexico City Grand Prix.
The Scot presented Mercedes driver Valtteri Bottas with a replica of Fangio's 1950s helmet and goggles for taking pole position.
Stewart, 82, was one of six pallbearers who carried the 84-year-old's coffin to the cemetery at the 1995 funeral in the Argentine city of Balcarce, to the west of Mar del Plata.
The other five, who included Fangio's former team mate Stirling Moss and Argentine racers Carlos Reutemann and Jose Froilan Gonzalez, have since died.
The procession around Balcarce on Wednesday, ahead of next weekend's Brazilian Grand Prix, will feature cars from the museum and local clubs.
""I'll never forget what happened that day,"" Stewart recalled of the funeral in Gerald Donaldson's biography of the man whose five titles have been surpassed only by the seven of Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton.
""There must have been 10,000 people gathered outside in the square, standing there in total silence. Absolutely amazing. And suddenly they just started to clap - 10,000 people clapping in slow motion.
""They were all in tears - 10,000 people in tears - and they all just wanted to touch the coffin of Fangio ... it was one of the most important things I have ever done in my life. I was an enormous fan of his.
""More than a fan, a great admirer of the manner in which he conducted his life, presented himself and represented the sport.""
Fangio dominated the first decade of grand prix racing and won the 1951 and 1954-57 world championships before retiring in 1958.

The Briton, who trails Red Bull rival and Mexico race winner Max Verstappen by 19 points with four races remaining, took to Instagram to clarify his words.
""Yesterday I said that VB left the door open and naturally people will jump to criticise,"" he said in relation to his observation that Bottas, on pole, left room for Verstappen to seize the lead into the first corner.
""We are a team and we win and we lose as a team. There is not one single person responsible for winning or losing, we do it together good or bad. You may be able to beat us but you can't break us.
""Onto the next one Valtteri, let’s keep pushing bro.""
Hamilton also told reporters after the race that he knew the Red Bull was quick because Perez had got close up behind him.
The Mercedes driver said on Monday he wanted to ""make sure people don’t read what I was saying wrong.""
""I have a lot of respect for (Perez) and think he’s doing a great job in his new team. He’s improved so much this season and I know how hard it is to progress with a new team, it takes time,"" he added.
""My comment was simply that following another car in Mexico is the hardest thing due to the low drag we all have. That’s why there is very little overtaking.
""However, he was able to follow so closely which highlights just how much more downforce they were able to carry.""

502,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/f1-plays-down-concern-over-pace-saudi-circuit-construction-2301551,F1 plays down concern over pace of Saudi circuit construction,"    Formula One's governing body has said it is confident Saudi Arabia will be ready for its grand prix debut next month after media reports highlighted the amount of track work still to be completed.
The floodlit night race along the Red Sea shore in Jeddah is scheduled for Dec. 5 as the penultimate round of the championship.
Depending on results in Brazil and Qatar, Saudi Arabia  could be a title decider between Red Bull's Max Verstappen and Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton. Verstappen leads Hamilton by 19 points with four races remaining.
""The FIA and F1 are getting daily updates of where things are at and it's progressing very, very quickly,"" FIA race director Michael Masi told reporters after last weekend's  Mexico City Grand Prix.
""I think everyone will acknowledge there's a lot to do but  still confident of the race going ahead, no problems."" 
The Australian said he had visited Jeddah a few weeks ago  and his past experience of new races in South Korea (in 2010) and India (2011), both now off the calendar, gave him confidence.
""Both of those went off, no problems at all, and I'm quite confident that Saudi will be exactly the same,"" he said.
The Jeddah Corniche layout has been billed as the world's fastest street circuit, with drivers expected to reach average speeds of 250kph and top speeds of 322kph.
Featuring 27 corners over 6.175km, it will be the second longest circuit on the calendar after Belgium's Spa-Francorchamps.
Masi said he had no concerns about the core elements being ready and in compliance with every safety requirement, and he would likely head there between the Brazil and Qatar races to take a look.
""They will finish, I have confidence,"" he said.

501,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/hamilton-favelas-hits-headlines-brazil-2301811,'Hamilton of the favelas' hits headlines in Brazil,"SAO PAULO :     A young Black driver on Brazil's motor racing circuits has won the moniker 'Hamilton of the favelas' and the popular prospect says he is inspired by seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton to travel the same path on and off the track.
Wallace Martins, who currently drives in the Formula Delta category, got the nickname from other drivers because of his similarities – in looks and driving style - to Hamilton.
An engaging 18-year-old, Martins does not mind the comparison and says one of his dreams is to emulate the Briton.
“I think he is a driver that is very dedicated to what he does,” Martins said. “He wins one race and he’s already thinking about winning the next one.
“And then there’s his story. He came from a poor neighbourhood and is Black and is the only Black driver in Formula 1. There’s a lot about his story that is inspiring.”
Like Hamilton, who has spoken about racism, the humble Martins has faced a number of obstacles in his fledgling career.
He is competing against people who have raced in the United States even though he has never been outside Brazil.
When he started out in the notoriously expensive motor racing business he would race once and then sit out the next two or three while friends and family sold t-shirts and organised whip-rounds to raise enough money to get him back on the grid.
During the pandemic he tested cars and worked as a mechanic in return for food for his family.
“None of it has been easy,” he told Reuters. “It’s got a lot better but it’s still not easy.”
KART RACING
Martins began kart racing aged 10 and after success there moved on to Formula Vee and then Formula Delta.
He has eight wins and 21 podiums from 44 career races, according to Driver DataBase, a motor racing website, and currently sits in third place in the Copa Yokohama, the trophy given to the best rider over the season’s last three races.
The final race is on Dec. 19 at Interlagos, the same circuit where Formula 1 drivers will race this weekend.
Recent stories focusing on Martins’ talent and struggles have helped attract sponsors and have also shone a light on his background as a poor Black man in an expensive sport.
“Everyone you see (racing) has a sponsor and when you ask them about it, it turns out they are the son of the shop’s owner or something like that,” Martins said, without a trace of bitterness. “So it’s a very elite sport.”
Martins knows how difficult it is to break into Formula 1.
Although Brazil is a hotbed for the sport, it has not had a top level driver since Felipe Massa retired in 2017 and no drivers' champion since Ayrton Senna in 1991.
In order to succeed Martins would have to leave Brazil and then climb through the ranks in Europe.
Though still a teenager, he is savvy enough to know that even at this level his presence is symbolic.
“I think about being an inspiration one day for young people, for diversity,” he said. “I feel like I am (breaking down barriers). I hope that other young people like me can one day reach a top level.”

The 62-year-old Briton, a former team mate of Germany's seven times world champion Michael Schumacher, was doing his pre-race 'grid walk' for Sky television in Austin when he tried to catch a word with rapper Megan Thee Stallion.
After approaching with a microphone to enquire whether she had any rap for F1, and being told she had ""no rap today"", Brundle asked her who she was supporting. A bodyguard then told him he could not do that.
""I can do that, because I did,"" replied Brundle, who has interviewed Hollywood A listers and sporting greats over the years, to the delight of many on social media.
A Formula One source confirmed to Reuters that bodyguards would no longer be allowed due to space limitations and COVID-19 restrictions, but celebrities would not be obliged to give interviews.
Brundle told his viewers on Sunday that new rules had been introduced and referred to a 'Brundle Clause'.
He took to Twitter on Tuesday to offer a further clarification.
""For the avoidance of doubt I don’t care who visits the F1 grid, the more the merrier. Talk to me, ignore me, shove, wave, hug, call me names, whatever makes you happy,"" he said. 
""All I ask is that you soak up the atmosphere, enjoy the privilege. I’ve not asked for any grid protocol changes.""

499,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/verstappen-can-sprint-further-clear-hamilton-brazil-2304776,Verstappen can sprint further clear of Hamilton in Brazil,"Formula One leader Max Verstappen can sprint to his third win in a row in Brazil on Sunday but Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes intend to hit back hard after painful defeats in Texas and Mexico.
Verstappen is 19 points ahead of seven-times world champion Hamilton with four races remaining and a first title is within the Dutchman's reach heading into the final stages of one of the closest and most exciting seasons in years.
His Red Bull team need to score two points more than Mercedes to take over at the top of the constructors' standings.
The 24-year-old Verstappen has nine victories to Hamilton's five this year and one more will mean he ends the season with the most, but Mercedes hope to regain lost momentum at Sao Paulo's Interlagos.
""We'll be throwing everything we've got at the Brazilian Grand Prix and the races beyond,"" said team boss Toto Wolff, using the old name of a race rebranded as the Sao Paulo Grand Prix.
""We're privileged to still be in the fight so late in the season and expect these titles to go right down to the wire, with both teams fighting hard to the very last lap,"" added the Austrian.
""We've got some catching up to do and know it'll be an intense battle, but we'll continue to push hard and keep our eyes firmly set on the end goal.""
The odds favour Verstappen, winner from pole last time Interlagos featured pre-pandemic in 2019. Hamilton won in 2016 and 2018 in front of a crowd that always brings something of a carnival atmosphere.
""It's not been our strongest track in recent seasons and has tended to suit Red Bull more, but this year has proved anything can happen,"" said Wolff.
""It's the last sprint race weekend, too, which opens up more opportunity.""
The sprint format - qualifying on Friday for a 100km race on Saturday to set Sunday's starting grid - has been trialled at Silverstone and Monza and is set to feature much more in 2022, with plans for six such races.
Points are awarded 3-2-1 for the top three on Saturday which means there is room for Verstappen to forge further ahead than usual or for Hamilton to rein in the advantage to a greater extent.
""I’m looking forward to Brazil. I have also very good memories there,"" Verstappen said after winning last weekend in Mexico City, while expecting Mercedes to be more competitive.
Hamilton was less sure of that.
""With their superior speed, if they were to carry that into the next ones then we may be in trouble - or we will be in trouble,"" he said.
There are also big battles being fought further down the field, with historic rivals Ferrari and McLaren scrapping for third place overall while Renault-owned Alpine and Red Bull's AlphaTauri are level on points in fifth.

Four of the current drivers have won in Brazil: Vettel (2010, 2013, 2017), Raikkonen (2007), Hamilton (2016, 2018), Verstappen (2019).
Brazil has been on the calendar since 1973, starting at Interlagos before moving to Rio de Janeiro and then returning to Sao Paulo. The circuit is named after Brazilian driver Jose Carlos Pace, who won there in 1975 and died in 1977.
Hamilton clinched his first title in Brazil with McLaren in 2008 with an overtake on the last corner of the final lap.
Sunday will be the 48th world championship grand prix in Brazil, and 38th at Interlagos. Michael Schumacher has the most wins at the Sao Paulo circuit, with four.
Since the start of the hybrid era in 2014, the winner has started on pole position five times out of six. The exception was Vettel, from second, in 2017.
There is no Brazilian driver on the starting grid. The country has produced six race winning drivers and three world champions.
This weekend will be the third time the Sprint format has been used, with qualifying on Friday for a 100km (24 lap) race on Saturday that determines the starting grid for Sunday's main race.
Points will be awarded to the top three on Saturday in a 3-2-1 system, meaning a maximum 29 points are available over the weekend (25 for a race win +1 for fastest lap + 3 for Sprint win).
The other two Sprint races were at Silverstone and Monza.
Hamilton has a record 100 career victories, of which 79 have been with Mercedes, from 284 starts. He has been on the podium 178 times.

Triple world champion Jackie Stewart joined the locals in Balcarce, some 415km south of Buenos Aires, in paying tribute to the man he still considers to be the greatest racing driver of all time.
This year is the 70th anniversary of the first of Fangio's five world championships won between 1951 and 1957 with four different constructors.
He died in 1995 aged 84, with Stewart now the last survivor of the six pallbearers - who included Fangio's former team mate Stirling Moss and Argentine racers Carlos Reutemann and Jose Froilan Gonzalez - at the funeral.
Wednesday's tribute saw the remains moved in a hearse, with ceremonial honours and draped in the national flag, from the city cemetery through the streets to the museum dedicated to Fangio near the house where he was born in 1911.
People stood and applauded as the procession went by.
""For me there can be no other racing driver who is more justified in having all of this occurring,"" Stewart had told Argentine media in Mar del Plata, where he arrived from attending the Mexican Grand Prix, on Tuesday.
""The fact that he is now going to be by his cars, in his museum, I think is a great, great honour to him,"" added the Scot.
""To be able to go into the same room that the great man is going to be in, whatever the difference of time and all that has gone with it. The spirit is still as strong as ever.""

Paris St Germain forward Neymar and Hamilton have hung out  on several occasions in the past, with the Brazilian once referring to the Formula One champion as a 'brother from another mother'.

Hamilton is 19 points adrift of Red Bull's Max Verstappen in the championship with four races remaining, including Interlagos.
Mercedes are only a point ahead of Red Bull in the constructors' championship.
This season has been one of the closest and hard-fought of  recent years, with the lead swinging between the two contenders, and Hamilton hoped next year could be even more competitive with new rules and cars.
He said that should make a difference when it came to getting more grip from the tyres and also reducing the turbulence of following another car.
""They have developed this new car so you can use less downforce while following another car, so we are really hoping that the racing is going be the best that Formula One has ever seen,"" he said.
The new cars will feature larger 18 inch wheels with covers and simpler front and rear wings designed to make it easier for drivers to overtake.

Haas team boss Guenther Steiner told reporters the overnight curfew had been waived and scrutineering times adjusted as a result of the problems, which he had heard were due to bad weather in Mexico.
""It's landed but I don't think everything is at the track yet,"" he said of the freight. 
""Apparently the plane landed. That was what I was told maybe 45 minutes ago so it should be all at the track in the next hours.

The Dutch driver told reporters at Brazil's Sao Paulo Grand Prix on Thursday that he would not hesitate to take the number one reserved for the world champion if he ends Lewis Hamilton's reign.
""Absolutely,"" said the 24-year-old, who has raced with the number 33 since his debut in 2015 and whose 'Orange Army' of fans follow him with it prominent on shirts, flags and even tattoos.
His Twitter handle is @Max33Verstappen.
""How many times do you have the opportunity to drive with number one? And it’s good for merchandise as well, you know. So it’s smart to do that,"" he said.
The number one was last raced in 2014, the year after Sebastian Vettel won his fourth championship in a row for Red Bull.
Seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton has raced with the number 44 while Mercedes team mate Nico Rosberg retired immediately after winning the 2016 title.
Verstappen is 19 points clear of Hamilton with four races remaining, including Sunday's at Interlagos, but he made clear that he was taking nothing for granted.
""In four races a lot of things can happen,"" he said. ""We are looking good but things can change very quickly ... I've had a bigger lead already in the championship and that disappeared within two race weekends.""
Nobody, however, will win more races this season than the nine he has so far. Hamilton is on five, half his average since 2014.
Verstappen has won the last two races in Texas and Mexico City, but he avoided partying last Sunday to fly straight to Brazil.
The Red Bull driver is in a relationship with Kelly Piquet, daughter of triple world champion Nelson, and they spent time at the family home.
Regarding meeting the 69-year-old Brazilian great, Verstappen said: ""I don't need advice ... we just had a good chat about all kinds of stuff. I know what I have to do in the car so I don't need to speak to anyone about that.""
Piquet's car collection also made a big impression.
""It's like the kind of dream garage that I would like to have in the future as well, with all different kind of cars,"" said Verstappen. ""I think it's a bit this little boy's dream that you want to have.""

""It's sad times. I'm going to miss him. He was the guy I watched when I was four, five, six years old. He got me into racing, got me onto a motorbike first,"" Norris added.
""He's been the guy that I've looked up to, the guy who's kind of helped me get to this position where I am because probably without watching him, my ambition of being a racing driver wouldn't have been so high.""
Norris would not divulge the details of Rossi's text and said it was in response to a ""little heartfelt message"" he sent saying how much he would miss him and congratulating him on what he had achieved.
Rossi, 41, is retiring after Sunday's season-ending race in Valencia, Spain, and will hang up his helmet as a nine-times world champion with seven titles in the top category of motorcycling.
Norris said he and Rossi talked ""now and then"" and still had plans to do some car racing together, mentioning GT sportscar events such as 12-hour races in Abu Dhabi and Dubai or even online.
""It's not just motorbikes that he likes. He loves car racing as well...If he can spend a bit more time to come to an F1 race, that is the plan for something we want to try and do together,"" he said.
Seven-times Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton, who swapped machinery with Rossi for fun at an event in Valencia in 2019, also paid tribute to the Italian.
""It's obviously sad to see Vale stopping but I think his drive, his approach, just everything he's done has been incredible,"" said the Mercedes driver.
""The passion that he's had for so long has shown through. And just such a legend, one of the greatest to ever do it.""

The 36-year-old Mercedes driver has five wins to his Dutch rival's nine this season, with Verstappen chasing his third in a row in Brazil this weekend.
Asked on Thursday whether he felt Sunday's Sao Paulo Grand Prix was a ""must-win"", the Briton replied that ""every race is a must-win race"".
Brazil is expected to favour the Red Bull more than Mercedes, with Verstappen the most recent winner there in 2019 and before the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of last year's race.
""They've had a strong car all year, they've had the strongest car,"" said Hamilton. ""I think we've done as good as we could. 
""Last time here they were incredibly strong so we're anticipating again they'll be very hard to beat this weekend. But where there's a will there's a way, hopefully.""
The Brazilian round will also be third and final sprint event of the season, with qualifying on Friday for a 100km race on Saturday that decides the starting grid for Sunday's main grand prix.
More points are available, with three for the winner on Saturday.
Hamilton said that would be of no benefit if Red Bull were quicker, and anti-clockwise Interlagos was one of the hardest layouts to overtake on.
There has also been speculation that Hamilton could need a new engine, which would trigger a five-place grid drop and further damage his title hopes.
""I can't really comment at the moment. I don't think the engines have even arrived this morning,"" he said, referring to delays in the freight arriving from Mexico. ""As far as I know, my engine's fine. But I'll find out later on.""

The Mercedes driver is 19 points adrift of Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who is building momentum with four races remaining.
Formula One's governing body confirmed on Friday that Hamilton had taken a new engine, his fifth of the 22-race campaign.
Drivers have three engines to last the season, with any more triggering a penalty of 10 places for the first time the limit is exceeded and then five places for subsequent engines.
Hamilton collected a 10 place grid penalty after taking his fourth engine in Turkey in October and started Friday practice at Interlagos with his fifth.
""We feel that we can score more points (this way),"" explained Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff, who said the engine Hamilton used in Mexico last weekend was degrading faster than expected and was only going to decrease in power.
""We haven't yet realised why that is,"" he added, saying that keeping the old engine would have meant Hamilton being uncompetitive in next month's final two races in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi.
""I think this is the final one that we need to take,"" said the Austrian.
Red Bull are favourites to win at Interlagos, with Dutch 24-year-old Verstappen chasing his third win in a row and 10th of the season. He won the last pre-pandemic race at the Sao Paulo circuit in 2019.
Verstappen started the Russian Grand Prix in September from the back of the grid, finishing second, due to power unit penalties.
Team boss Christian Horner saw no need for Red Bull, who are only a point behind Mercedes in the constructors' championship,  to take any further engines.
""It's entirely understandable that Mercedes would strategically decide to take that penalty here, which they will incur on Sunday,"" he told Sky Sports television. ""We're just focused on ourselves and do the best job we can.
""All things being normal, we expect to get to the end of the year with the combustion engines that we have. 
""Obviously we lost one following the crash at Silverstone (in July between Hamilton and Verstappen) but with the penalty we took in Sochi that got us back into good shape.""

""I've just realised we're only one point ahead in the constructors' championship and that's the most important one, really,"" Hamilton told Sky Sports television at Interlagos.
""I want to win the drivers' championship, of course. But the team one is so important, for the funding you get for the development, for all the people who are working back at the factory.
""It's not just about one person, it's about all of those. When it comes to team mates working together, that's the one we really need to work together for to come out on top.""
Red Bull have whittled away Mercedes' lead in the standings, with Verstappen and his Mexican team mate Sergio Perez both on the podium in Mexico City last weekend.
Verstappen has won the last two races and is chasing his 10th win of the season, to Hamilton's five so far.
""Winning at least one of the championships is key,"" said Hamilton.
""If we can't get the drivers' championship, I at least want to deliver for the team and get the constructors, so that's what I'm working towards. But it's just hard.""

Seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton collected his second grid drop of the championship at Brazil's Sao Paulo Grand Prix with his fifth engine - two more than drivers are allowed for the season.
Team mate Valtteri Bottas is already on his sixth.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who leads Hamilton by 19 points with four races to go, is meanwhile on his fourth Honda engine as is Mexican team mate Sergio Perez and they do not expect to need any more.
""I am very surprised they (Mercedes) are changing the ICE (internal combustion engine) frequently. Actually, I cannot believe what's going on,"" Honda's Toyoharu Tanabe told reporters.
""From the PU (power unit) manufacturer point of view, it's kind of disappointing to get a PU penalty for the driver.""
Mercedes have won the last seven drivers' and constructors' championships, with Hamilton chasing a record eighth title this season.
Honda had a torrid time with McLaren on their return to the sport as an engine supplier in 2015 after a highly successful earlier partnership with the Woking team in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
In 2017, McLaren driver Stoffel Vandoorne had a meaningless 65-place grid penalty for his home Belgian Grand Prix after Honda replaced his car's power unit. 
Other penalties in excess of 30 places were not unusual at the team, and frustrated double world champion Fernando Alonso famously compared the engine to one in a GP2 car at Honda's home Japanese Grand Prix in 2015.
At that year's Brazilian GP the Spaniard famously watched qualifying from a trackside deckchair after his McLaren broke down.
The Japanese manufacturer and McLaren split at the end of 2017 when the team finished ninth overall, with Honda teaming up with Red Bull, who are now closing in on a first title since 2013.
McLaren are powered by Mercedes, after three years with Renault, and fighting for third overall. Mercedes are one point ahead of Red Bull in the constructors' standings.
Honda are leaving the sport at the end of this season, however, with Red Bull set to take over the intellectual property and build their own powertrain.

Reports in France have linked the experienced paddock insider to a future restructuring of Alpine.
Silverstone-based Aston Martin, owned by Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll, have recently brought in former McLaren team boss Martin Whitmarsh as group chief executive, above Szafnauer.
Szafnauer took to Instagram on Thursday to say the speculation was ""not based on fact"" and told reporters at Interlagos that he was as surprised as anyone by the media reports.
""I have no intention of leaving,"" he said, adding that it was ""humbling and flattering"" to be talked about in such a manner.
""I love this team ... I've been loyal to this team. I've had many, many offers in the 12 years that I've been working for this team, especially in the days of (Force India) bankruptcy and insolvency. 
""I could have left many times, but I'm loyal to the employees there.""
Szafnauer did not directly deny talks with Alpine or state with certainty where his future lay, however. He said also that he had not been asked by Stroll, absent from Brazil, for any clarification. 
""I learned a long, long time ago that predicting the future is an impossibility. And if I could do that, I would be in Vegas now,"" he said.

On a day of drama in Brazil after qualifying for a Saturday sprint race that determines Sunday's starting grid, Mercedes driver Hamilton and then Red Bull's championship leader Verstappen caught the stewards' attention.
Seven times world champion Hamilton dominated qualifying at  the Interlagos circuit but his car then failed a technical check, with the risk of demotion to the back of the sprint field.
Stewards ordered the rear wing assembly to be impounded and the car stored overnight.
A spokesman for the governing FIA said the officials were awaiting further evidence that would not be available until  morning.
A statement then delivered another bombshell by summoning  Verstappen and a team representative to a meeting at 0930 local time (1230 GMT) for an alleged breach of the international sporting code.
Video footage posted by a fan on social media showed Verstappen seemingly checking with his hands the rear wings of his Red Bull and Hamilton's Mercedes after they had parked up post-qualifying.
Article 2.5.1 of the sporting code states that ""no operation, checking, tuning or repair is allowed"" in that secure  area unless authorised by officials.
NEW ENGINE
Hamilton, 19 points adrift of Verstappen with four races remaining, already has a five-place grid penalty for Sunday's race after Mercedes changed the engine in his car.
The Briton had clocked a fastest time of one minute 07.934 seconds with Verstappen 0.438 slower, a considerable margin around one of the shortest laps on the calendar.
""Let's go,"" exclaimed Hamilton over the team radio.
Three points are to be won in the sprint but Hamilton's chances of taking them were thrown into doubt by a measurement of millimetres.
Formula One technical delegate Jo Bauer reported the uppermost rear wing adjustable positions did not comply with the rules for a maximum distance of 85mm when the drag reduction system was deployed.
Hamilton had earlier told reporters the car was finally performing to his liking.
""A lot of the times we get it wrong, I get it wrong, and today I got it right and the car was really nice to drive. It was everything I wanted,"" he said. 
Verstappen said Hamilton's new engine had clearly made a difference.
""For me it’s not a big shock. I’m just happy to be second. That’s a good position to start from. Of course you always want to be closer but sometimes you just have to be realistic and there was not much more in it,"" he said.
The 100km sprint is the last of three in the experimental format this season, with the other two being at Monza and Silverstone.
Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas was third fastest with Red Bull's Sergio Perez alongside on the second row.
""Lewis was untouchable today,"" said Perez.
Team boss Christian Horner agreed: ""That fresh engine is obviously pumping out some horsepower for (Hamilton) so I think second was the best we could hope for,"" he said.
""If you look at the relative speed (of Hamilton) compared to Valtteri it's a couple of tenths."" 
AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly starts fifth with the two Ferraris of Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc followed by the two McLarens of Lando Norris and Daniel Ricciardo in the battle for third overall.
Fernando Alonso qualified 10th for Alpine.
Further back George Russell was out-qualified by Williams team mate Nicholas Latifi - the first time that has happened although the actual grand prix grid positions will not be decided until Saturday.

Seven times world champion Hamilton, fastest on Friday, meanwhile risks being sent to the back of the grid or a pit lane start for the 100km sprint after the rear wing of his Mercedes failed a technical inspection.

The Dutch 24-year-old, who leads seven times world champion Hamilton by 19 points with four races left, qualified second for Saturday's 100km sprint race that determines the starting grid for Sunday's grand Prix at Brazil's Interlagos.
After the session on Friday Verstappen inspected the rear wing elements on his car and Hamilton's Mercedes, touching them with his hands.
Later that afternoon the governing FIA revealed that Hamilton's car had failed a technical inspection by a matter of millimetres.
The Briton risks being sent to the back of the grid or forced to start in the pitlane for the sprint race. He also already has a five place grid penalty for Sunday's grand prix due to an engine change.
The stewards said in a statement that Verstappen had breached article 2.5.1 of the international sporting code. The article covers behaviour in the secure 'parc ferme' area after qualifying.
It stipulates that no unauthorised ""operation, checking, tuning or repair is allowed"".
In-car footage and video filmed by a fan was looked at by stewards as part of the hearing.
It clearly showed Verstappen getting out of his car, removing his gloves and putting his right hand into the slot gap of the Red Bull's rear wing. He then moved to the Mercedes and did the same, touching the rear wing in two places.
The stewards' report said there was no movement of any of the wing elements of Hamilton's car when touched with what they described as ""insignificant force"".
""It is clear to the stewards that it has become a habit of the drivers to touch cars after qualifying and the races,"" it added.
""This was also the explanation of Verstappen, that it was simply habit to touch this area of the car which has been a point of speculation in recent races between both teams.
""This general tendency has been seen as mostly harmless and so has not been uniformly policed. Nevertheless, it is a breach of the parc fermé regulation and has significant potential to cause harm.""
Stewards decided a fine was sufficient on this occasion but warned teams that future incidents could incur different penalties.
Red Bull team boss Christian Horner earlier told Sky Sports television that his cars had been on the receiving end of similar hands-on treatment in the past.

The Mercedes driver will start 10th on Sunday after a five place penalty for an engine change.
""It's not over yet,"" Hamilton said over the team radio after gaining 15 positions in 24 laps.
He finished with a flourish, sweeping past the McLaren of fellow-Briton Lando Norris on the last lap as the crowd stood and cheered.
""I honestly had no idea what was possible. I didn't set a limit or a maximum,"" said Hamilton, who would have started at the front but was demoted to the back after his car's rear wing failed a technical check.
""Then all of a sudden I was chipping away at it much faster...you can't give up, you've just got to keep pushing."" 
Bottas took three points for the sprint win, stretching Mercedes' lead over Red Bull in the constructors' standings to two points and also doing Hamilton a service.
Verstappen, who had lined up in the number one slot, lost out to Bottas at the start and was then also passed by Ferrari's Carlos Sainz.
The Dutch 24-year-old took back second on lap four and stayed there to bank the two points.
""The start was the key thing for me,"" said Bottas, who has now taken pole at three of the last four races. ""We gambled a bit with the soft tyre, we knew it would be a benefit at the start and it worked.""
Sainz was third, after also opting to start on the soft tyres, and took the final point available with Red Bull's Sergio Perez fourth.
Sunday's race will be almost three times longer and Hamilton, with a fresher engine than those ahead of him, will be targeting the podium - and could even be in with a chance of the win.
""Brilliant drive. Damage limitation,"" said Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff after a difficult day.
Norris and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc will share the third row in fifth and sixth respectively after Hamilton's penalty with AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly seventh and Alpine's Esteban Ocon eighth.
Aston Martin's four times world champion Sebastian Vettel starts ninth and just ahead of Hamilton. 
The sprint was the third race weekend of the year using the experimental format, after Silverstone and Monza, and Formula One managing director Ross Brawn liked what he saw.
""This sprint was the best one so far with plenty of action and a great crowd to witness it all,"" said the Briton, who plans to expand the format to six rounds next year. 
""The drama off the track created something fixating on it, with Lewis overtaking car after car. Without the sprint, he would be at the back of the grid for tomorrow's race but instead he has a real chance tomorrow.""

The seven-time world champion battled back through the field to finish fifth, leaving him 10th on Sunday's main race grid after a penalty for exceeding his season's engine allocation is applied.
His car failed the technical inspection after he dominated Friday qualifying for the new format 100km sprint at Interlagos, with checks showing the gap between the rear wing elements was too wide.
Wolff said the wing, which was impounded by the governing FIA and had yet to be returned, was damaged in qualifying and the matter should not have gone to the stewards.
He said Hamilton, now 21 points behind Red Bull's Max Verstappen with four races to go, had been in disbelief after the stewards' ruling.
""Discovering that we've marginally failed the test, we are speaking 0.2 of a millimetre, to not allowing this to be fixed like the normal protocol would be...there the bullet was out of the gun,"" said the Austrian.
""The wing was damaged. One side was OK, the middle was OK, the right side was not OK, and that means we actually had a performance disadvantage.
""We thought that, in consideration of all these aspects, the FIA would say there was a damage and therefore we weren't in breach of the regulations."" 
Wolff said he thought sporting director Ron Meadows was joking when he told him the news.
""Strange things happen but you have to take it on the chin, and the last 60 minutes of motor racing from Valtteri and from Lewis brought all the enjoyment back with all the frustrations that happened before,"" he added.
Hamilton's team mate Valtteri Bottas qualified on pole position for Sunday's race.

480,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/hamilton-feels-love-absence-brazilian-drivers-2313171,Hamilton feels the love in absence of Brazilian drivers,"SAO PAULO :With no Brazilian drivers on the Formula One starting grid, local fans gave seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton plenty of love at Interlagos on Sunday and the feeling was mutual.
The Mercedes driver celebrated one of his greatest wins with a gesture made famous by late triple world champion and local hero Ayrton Senna, carrying the Brazilian flag during the slowing down lap.
As he did, the crowd started chanting his name along with that of Senna.
The Briton, the most successful driver in the history of the sport with 101 race wins, later carried the flag onto the podium and received an ovation from the crowd at one of the most atmospheric circuits on the calendar.
""I'm so, so grateful for the incredible support I've had this weekend. I've not had it since Silverstone,"" Hamilton said.
""Obrigado (thank you) Brasil,"" he added in Portuguese.
Hamilton won his first title at Interlagos with McLaren in 2008, beating Ferrari's then local favourite Felipe Massa with a devastating overtake at the last corner of the last lap of the final round of the season.
Massa retired in 2017, since when there has been no Brazilian competing regularly.
The last was U.S.-born Pietro Fittipaldi as a stand-in last season at Haas following Romain Grosjean's fiery crash in Bahrain.
SENNA CONNECTION
Hamilton has won over the crowd since 2008 with his praise of the country and his connection to Senna, who died at Imola in 1994 and was his boyhood inspiration.
""Senna has always been his idol ... every time he comes to Brazil, he brings a special homage,"" said Anderson Cardoso, a Hamilton supporter attending the grand prix.
""I think a great part of the Brazilians hope that he will be able to turn around this championship,"" added Everton da Silva, also a Hamilton fan, referring to the Briton's current standing.
The 36-year-old now trails Verstappen by 14 points with three races remaining.
Cardoso said he still missed having a Brazilian driver to support in a country that gave the sport multiple world champions Senna, Nelson Piquet and Emerson Fittipaldi.
Will there ever be another one?
""I hope, of course,"" Massa told Reuters. ""Given Brazil's tradition in motor racing, it is sad not to have a Brazilian driver carrying our flag out there"".
Massa was also on hand after the race to interview the top three finishers.
""You are not the driver of the day, you are the driver of the weekend,"" he told his former rival.
Hamilton thanked him and replied: ""I think I feel what it was like for you here, with all the support.""

Verstappen finished second with Valtteri Bottas third for Mercedes after a controversial, roller-coaster weekend in Brazil.
""I don't remember another weekend like this,"" said Hamilton, his dream of a record eighth title back on with three races remaining. ""It's quite overwhelming, to be honest.""
""This has been probably one of the best weekends, if not the best weekend, that I have experienced since ... probably in my whole career.""  
The Briton was fastest in Friday qualifying at Interlagos for Saturday's sprint that set Sunday's grid, and then demoted to the back of the field after his car's rear wing failed a technical inspection.
He went from 20th to fifth on Saturday, dropping back to  10th on Sunday's grid after an engine penalty but hungry for much more. 
The rest was history as the 36-year-old took his third win at Interlagos and set a record for victory in Brazil from the lowest grid position, beating Italian Giancarlo Fisichella's 2003 win from eighth.
""Lewis, that's how you overcome a 20-place disqualification,"" Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff told him over the radio after he took the chequered flag in front of a cheering crowd.
""It was actually 25, but you're right,"" replied Hamilton.
The win was Hamilton's sixth of the season and record-extending 101st of his career.
""That was one of the best drives I've ever seen in F1. By anyone. Utterly awesome,"" commented 1996 world champion Damon Hill on Twitter.
""I feel like Lewis was in his own league today,"" said Bottas.
Red Bull's Sergio Perez finished fourth, pitting at the end  for fresh tyres to set the fastest lap and deny Hamilton a precious bonus point.
Mercedes moved 11 points clear of Red Bull in the constructors' standings. 
WHEEL-TO-WHEEL
Bottas had started on pole but lost out to Verstappen into the first corner and then to Perez while Hamilton was already up to seventh.
The reigning champion was third by lap five, with Bottas letting him through as expected.
The 3.5 second gap to Perez was closed a lap later when the safety car was deployed after a clash between AlphaTauri's Yuki Tsunoda and Aston Martin's Lance Stroll left debris strewn across the track.
Perez was then passed on lap 18, after a further virtual safety car period when the front wing on Mick Schumacher's Haas  detached and left more debris.
Then it was game on, with Hamilton pitting before Verstappen and cutting the gap.
The Dutch 24-year-old was determined not to be undercut again and jumped first for the second stop on lap 41 with Hamilton coming in three laps later and then closing in with the advantage of fresher tyres and a newer engine.
Both battled wheel-to-wheel on lap 48, Verstappen defending hard.
Hamilton got ahead but Verstappen closed him out and both cars ran wide, Mercedes complaining their man was pushed off unfairly, with the stewards ultimately deciding to take no further action.
Hamilton tried again before making the move stick third time around while marshals waved a black and white flag at Verstappen for weaving on the straight, drawing a sarcastic response: ""Yeah, perfect. Say hi"".
GOOD BATTLE
""It was a good battle but at the end we just missed a little bit of pace. We gave it our all today, it was a lot of fun,"" said Verstappen.
""We still have a good points lead. Today was a bit of damage limitation on a weekend that was difficult for us. I'm confident that the coming races we will bounce back.""
Two of the remaining three are circuits new to F1 - Qatar and Saudi Arabia - before the finale in Abu Dhabi.
Ferrari's Charles Leclerc finished fifth with team mate Carlos Sainz sixth.
AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly was seventh, ahead of the Alpine pairing of Esteban Ocon and Fernando Alonso. Lando Norris took the final point for McLaren despite a puncture on the opening lap.
Australian Daniel Ricciardo retired his McLaren after a loss of power.

The International Automobile Federation, known as FIA, wants the F1 cars to use only sustainable fuels by 2025.
Shell, which has a 70-year partnership with Ferrari, expects the use of ethanol on the racing track to attract more consumers to use it, as global initiatives such as India's push forward its targets to raise ethanol percentages blended into gasoline.
Raizen, Shell's joint venture with Brazilian sugar and ethanol producer Cosan SA is one of the few energy companies with commercial sales of second-generation ethanol, which is made from non-food biomass and generates 86 per cent less emissions than fossil fuels.
The second-generation ethanol to be used by Ferrari is made of sugarcane bagasse, a byproduct that used to be thrown away. Second-generation ethanol is already produced in a Raizen unit in the Sao Paulo state countryside and raises ethanol productivity by 50 per cent without adding planted area, according to Raizen.
The company is building a second factory to produce cellulosic ethanol, which will raise annual second-generation ethanol capacity from 40 million litres to 120 million litres by 2023.
""We currently produce 4 billion litres of first-generation ethanol, so we could have additional 2 billion litres of second generation with no increase in planted area"" said Raizen CEO Ricardo Mussa.
Mussa said each new unit to produce second-generation ethanol costs between 800 million reais (US$146 million) and 1 billion reais (US$183.2 million). The CEO added Raizen may have up to 35 second-generation ethanol units.
The Raizen agreement may give Ferrari an advantage in the fuel blend, as the other teams will most probably use first- generation ethanol in the first blend with 10 per cent of renewable fuel. ""We will not supply second-generation ethanol to the other teams"", said Shell Mobility vice president Istvan Kapitany in an interview to Reuters.
Kapitány said Shell thinks the fuel can increase Ferrari team's competitiveness. After F1 cars use second-generation ethanol, it will be launched to general consumers, the executive added, as Shell has already done with fuels and lubricants initially tested on the race track. Ferrari, Shell and Raizen did not disclose financial terms of the partnership.",['478_0'],"[""\nFerrari's Charles Leclerc in action during qualifying. (Photo: REUTERS/Juan Medina)\n""]"

Seven-times world champion Hamilton had a rollercoaster ride over the weekend, starting with qualifying fastest and then being demoted to last on the grid for Saturday's sprint race when his car failed a technical check.
The Briton fought back from 20th to fifth in that race before dropping to 10th on Sunday's grid due to an engine penalty.
In the race he and Red Bull's championship leader Max Verstappen went wheel-to-wheel, with the Dutch driver defending so firmly that both cars ran off the track, before Hamilton prevailed.
""The whole weekend went against us. We had a broken part on our rear wing which we couldn't look at, couldn't analyse, failed the test and got disqualified ... very harsh,"" said Wolff of the qualifying drama.
""And then you see on the Red Bull, repairs three times in a row on their rear wing whilst being in parc fermé with no consequence.""
Wolff said Verstappen should then have been handed a five second penalty ""at least"" for going too far in defending against Hamilton, but stewards instead decided to take no further action.
""Just brushing it under the carpet is just the tip of the iceberg. It's laughable,"" said Wolff.
""I think the stewards have a difficult life anyway ... whatever decision they take, one team is going to be grumpy,"" he added.
""In a certain way, when you are taking punches all weekend and then you have such a situation on top of everything, you are just losing faith in a way.""
Michael Masi, the governing FIA's race director, told reporters all drivers and teams were treated equally and fairly at all times.
""Obviously if you are on the receiving end of a penalty I think everyone feels unfairly treated,"" he said.

The seven-times world champion went from 20th and the back of the field in a Saturday sprint to 10th on the grid for the Sao Paulo Grand Prix at Interlagos and then to the top of the podium.
Hamilton said his father had reminded him of how in a Formula Three weekend in Bahrain in 2004 he went from 22nd in qualifying to 11th in the sprint to decide the grid and then won the main race.
""After that showing McLaren re-signed me,"" he said. ""I was fighting for my career at the time. Without them I wouldn’t have been able to make it to Formula One.""
Hamilton is now fighting for a record eighth title, his victory at Interlagos leaving the 36-year-old 14 points adrift of Red Bull's Max Verstappen with three races remaining and all to play for.
He said he had gone in 'guns blazing' after the Saturday setback and was relentless in passing rivals and hunting down the Dutchman.
""This is what a world championship battle should look like,"" he said of Sunday's scrap, with the pair going wheel to wheel and Verstappen defending with determination until Hamilton finally made a move stick.
""It’s hard battling and wouldn’t expect anything less really. We didn’t touch wheels, which is good,"" he said of the most controversial incident that saw both going off track as they battled on lap 48.
Damon Hill, Britain's 1996 world champion and former rival of Michael Schumacher, said on Twitter that Hamilton's performance was ""one of the best drives I've ever seen in F1. By anyone. Utterly awesome.""
Hamilton, now the winner of a record 101 races, thanked his compatriot for the compliment.
""I really do feel, from my own personal experience, it’s been one of the most challenging, if not the most challenging with the things that we’ve faced during the weekend,"" he told reporters.
Hamilton said the weekend had been difficult for everyone at the team but he had been inspired by their focus and determination.
""I didn't know what was possible but I just gave it everything,"" he said. 
""This has been probably one of the best weekends, if not THE best weekend, that I've experienced probably in my whole career.""

The Dutch 24-year-old is now 14 points ahead of seven times world champion Hamilton with three races remaining.
""We still have a good points lead you know, so today was a bit of damage limitation on a weekend where it was a bit difficult but I’m confident that in the coming races we’ll bounce back,"" he said.
""I had fun out there. Of course I like to win but I think second today, with the defence I did, it’s also satisfying and, of course, we’re still ahead in the Championship.
""It’s been like this the whole year, hasn’t it,"" he said of the points gap widening and narrowing between the two contenders.
Verstappen defended strongly against Hamilton, who had a new engine for the race, with a turn four incident between the two on lap 48 the major talking point.
Hamilton tried to overtake but Verstappen moved across and closed the door, both cars going off the track together with accusations that the Red Bull driver had gone too far and gained an unfair advantage.
Stewards took an immediate look but decided against imposing any time penalty.
""We both, of course, tried to be ahead into the corner and so I braked a bit later to try and keep the position,"" said Verstappen.
""The tyres were already a bit worn so I was really on the edge of grip...so then it’s a safer way of just running a bit wide there.

MERCEDES (Lewis Hamilton 1, Valtteri Bottas 3)
Hamilton's 101st race win, sixth of the season, third in Brazil and 80th for Mercedes. He started 10th on the grid after a five place grid drop for a new engine. He had been last on the grid for the Saturday sprint and ended the weekend 14 points behind Verstappen, after overtaking him on lap 58. Bottas started on pole but lost out to Verstappen at the start and ran wide as Perez passed. He then let Hamilton through. The podium was the 66th of his career. Mercedes lead Red Bull by 11 points.
RED BULL (Max Verstappen 2, Sergio Perez 4)
Verstappen seized the lead from Bottas at the start, and tried hard to fend off Hamilton with the pair going wheel-to-wheel at turn four on lap 48 and running wide. After stretching his lead to 21 points after the Saturday sprint, Verstappen saw his advantage trimmed back to 14. Perez pitted at the end for fresh tyres to seize the fastest lap from Hamilton.
FERRARI (Charles Leclerc 5, Carlos Sainz 6) 
Ferrari extended their lead over McLaren to 31.5 points. Sainz made a sluggish start from third on the grid and made contact with Norris, losing out to Perez and Leclerc. The Spaniard has now scored in his last 12 races. 
MCLAREN (Lando Norris 10, Daniel Ricciardo retired)
Norris, who celebrated his 22nd birthday on Saturday, started fifth but collected a puncture on the opening lap as he tried to pass Sainz and dropped to the back of the field with floor damage. Ricciardo retired on lap 51 with a loss of power after starting 11th.
ALPINE (Esteban Ocon 8, Fernando Alonso 9)
Alpine stayed level on points with AlphaTauri, but ahead thanks to Ocon's win in Hungary. Ocon let Alonso through in the fight with Gasly to try and get an aerodynamic tow but the pair later reversed positions.
ALPHATAURI (Pierre Gasly 7, Yuki Tsunoda 15)
Tsunoda's race was ruined by a collision with Stroll at turn one that scattered debris across the track and brought out the safety car. The Japanese rookie collected a 10 second penalty for causing the collision. Gasly passed both Alpines.    
ASTON MARTIN (Sebastian Vettel 11, Lance Stroll retired) 
Stroll retired after the collision with Tsunoda left his car too damaged to continue. Vettel was sixth at the one third distance but pitted just before the virtual safety car period and dropped out of the points.
WILLIAMS (George Russell 13, Nicholas Latifi 16)
Both ran two-stop strategies but ultimately lacked pace. Russell at least managed to beat one of the Alfa Romeos.
ALFA ROMEO (Kimi Raikkonen 12, Antonio Giovinazzi 14)
Raikkonen started from the pit lane due to the team replacing components and made up eighth places. Giovinazzi got stuck behind Russell.
HAAS (Nikita Mazepin 17, Mick Schumacher 18)
Schumacher hit Raikkonen's Alfa on lap 11, with the front wing of the German's car wedged under the Haas briefly. Mazepin made a good start and raced in the midfield for a while.

472,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/gloves-are-truly-between-mercedes-and-red-bull-2315611,The gloves are truly off between Mercedes and Red Bull ,"Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen shook hands after the Sao Paulo Grand Prix but the gloves are now well and truly off between Formula One rivals Mercedes and Red Bull as the championship enters the final straight.
As Hamilton celebrated his 101st win, and possibly the greatest race of his F1 career to revive his hopes of a record eighth world title, Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff vented his feelings.
The Austrian spoke of Hamilton's 'harsh' disqualification from Friday's qualifying and the stewards 'laughable' decision not to penalise Verstappen when the Dutch driver ""forced"" the champion off the road on Sunday as he tried to overtake.
His sense of injustice was palpable, as well as the feeling that Mercedes were fighting forces greater than Red Bull even as Hamilton closed the gap to Verstappen to 14 points with three races remaining.
""The team has always been together but these decisions have brought us so close together,"" said Wolff.
""It's against us and I think this is what Lewis felt all his life and we now feel it together as a team and we're going to fight. And we are not going to be the victims. That is the emotion we're feeling in the garage at the moment.""
On the Red Bull side, there was also a pervading sense of suspicion.
Verstappen was fined 50,000 euros (US$57,000) on Saturday for literally taking his gloves off to feel with his hands the rear wing element of Hamilton's car after qualifying - a clear breach of the sporting code.
The gesture reflected the questions being asked at his team about why the Mercedes was so fast and what was going on with its wing.
Wolff's tone was steely on Saturday, after Hamilton went from last to fifth in a sprint race setting the grid for Sunday.
He was particularly vexed by Hamilton's car failing a rear wing inspection, when Red Bull had been allowed to tape theirs' up without penalty previously.
The demotion from first to last cost him any chance of the three points available to the Saturday sprint winner, points that could be crucial at the end of the season.
Wolff spoke of a previous ""commonsense buffer"", a 'modus operandi' that he said had been dismantled in a break with the past.
""If the modus operandi is different now, you maybe need to look at others also with a more strict and severe eye,"" he declared.
""I can tell you that in the next few races we are going to look at every single race tape that's going to fall off a car and ask questions.
""If such a thing as a gentlemans' agreement exists in Formula One, because there ain't no gentlemen, then now it doesn't any more. You have no millimetre of leniency of fixing things on a car.""
Red Bull boss Christian Horner said the straight line speed of the Mercedes was eye-popping and something his team wanted to understand.
""It's up to the FIA to police the sport and to govern it,"" he said when asked about a possible protest in future. ""We trust in them and their tests and their investigation.""
Asked by Sky television if Verstappen had felt anything when he got his hands on the rear wing element of Hamilton's car, Horner gave nothing away other than a quip.
""Well, he felt about 50 grand,"" he said.",['472_0'],"[""\nFormula One F1 - Brazilian Grand Prix - Jose Carlos Pace Circuit, Sao Paulo, Brazil - November 14, 2021 Red Bull's Max Verstappen and Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton during the press conference FIA/Handout via REUTERS   ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN SUPPLIED BY A THIRD PARTY.

471,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/first-chinese-driver-big-moment-formula-one-2317061,First Chinese driver is a big moment for Formula One,"Alfa Romeo announced Guanyu Zhou as China's first Formula One racing driver on Tuesday with his arrival in 2022 hailed by both the team and the sport as a historic breakthrough in a key growth market.
The 22-year-old will partner Finnish driver Valtteri Bottas, who is joining from Mercedes after five seasons alongside seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton, in an all-new line-up.
Formula One chief executive Stefano Domenicali said the signing was ""fantastic for the sport and millions of passionate Chinese fans that now have a home hero to cheer all year long.""
""Zhou is an incredible talent, who will be a fantastic addition to the amazing grid we have and he will entertain and keep all our Chinese fans excited in 2022,"" Domenicali said.
The youngster takes the place of Ferrari-backed Italian driver Antonio Giovinazzi, while Finnish veteran Kimi Raikkonen is retiring.
""The decision is crucial for the future of the company,"" said Alfa team principal Frederic Vasseur, whose team are ninth out of 10 in the constructors' standings.
""It was not only based on the fact that he is Chinese but it will be a mega-push for the company, for sponsors and I think also for F1 in general,"" he told Reuters.
""He's a front-runner in F2, he won in Bahrain and Silverstone this season and is still in a position to win the championship and it’s a very good combination at the end. I’m more than optimistic.""
Zhou is a test driver for the Renault-owned Alpine F1 team this season, and drove their car in Friday practice in Austria last July.
He is also second in the Formula Two standings, with two weekends to come in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi.
""I dreamt from a young age of climbing as high as I can in a sport that I'm passionate about and now the dream has come true,"" said Zhou in a team statement.
""To be the first ever Chinese driver in Formula One is a breakthrough for Chinese motorsport history.""
Vasseur said Zhou would be severing his ties with Alpine.
""He's a completely free agent, free management ... I don't want to have someone linked with another team who if everything is going well will leave. This was not an option at all for me,"" he said.
Zhou is likely to bring considerable backing from China, some reports suggesting as much as US$30 million, but Vasseur would not be drawn on the details or duration of the contract.
""We are 200per cent focused on the performance of the team and we don’t have to hide the fact that the budget is part of the performance and we are also targeting to get to the cost cap because it’s an important step for us,"" he said.
Formula One introduced a US$145 million budget cap this season, with the figure set to drop to US$135 million in 2023.

Red Bull's championship leader Verstappen appeared to force Mercedes' seven times world champion Hamilton off the track as they jostled for the lead at Interlagos last Sunday.
The stewards took note of the lap 48 incident during the race but concluded, on the basis of the evidence they had, that  no investigation was necessary.
Hamilton eventually passed Verstappen 11 laps later and took the win https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-motor-f1-brazil-hamilton-idCAKBN2HZ0IV.
""(Mercedes) confirms that we have today requested a Right of Review under Article 14.1.1 of the International Sporting Code, in relation to the Turn 4 incident between Car 44 and Car 33 on lap 48 of the Brazilian Grand prix, on the basis of new evidence unavailable to the Stewards at the time of their decision,"" the  team said in a statement. 
The article allows stewards to re-examine their decision if ""a significant and relevant new element is discovered which was unavailable to the parties seeking the review at the time of the decision concerned.""
Race director Michael Masi revealed after the grand prix that stewards had not had access to now-released forward-facing cockpit video footage from Verstappen's car.
""Only the cameras that were broadcast... is what we have access to,"" he said.
""The forward-facing, the 360 (degrees), all of the camera angles that we don't get live, that will be downloaded and we'll have a look at them post-race.""
Mercedes were particularly interested in the forward-facing video to see what steering movements Verstappen had made, with team boss Toto Wolff saying the Dutch driver should have received at least a five-second penalty.
In a dramatic weekend, Hamilton was disqualified from Friday's qualifying and given a five-place grid penalty for using a new internal combustion engine at Interlagos. 
Verstappen, on the other hand, was fined 50,000 euros  (US$56,710) on Saturday for putting his hands on the rear wing element of Hamilton's car to inspect it after qualifying, a breach of the sporting code. 
Hamilton is 14 points behind Verstappen with three races remaining and the next in Qatar this weekend.

Neighbouring Qatar, which hosts F1 for the first time this weekend, has been accused of exploiting migrant workers ahead of  the 2022 soccer World Cup, with international concern over building site fatalities.
Saudi GP chief executive Martin Whitaker said his circuit put some 10,000 workers through a safety induction programme, but recognised questions would be asked.
""I think we've had just under eight million man hours put into the circuit so far and we haven't had a major incident,"" the Briton told Reuters.
""We're monitored regularly by Formula One. Formula One sent their own team here to look at what we're doing. We're under scrutiny the whole time.
""We're proud to say we're doing what is right under the national regulations and Formula One's strict regulations in terms of making sure worker rights are looked after.""
Formula One chief executive Stefano Domenicali separately told the BBC that the contracts with Saudi Arabia and Qatar contained guarantees that the countries must respect human rights in all aspects of their involvement in the sport.
Whitaker said 40per cent of those working for the Saudi Arabia Grand Prix organisation were female.
""This is probably the first just-in-time Formula One circuit that's ever been built,"" said Whitaker. ""There's a tremendous amount of work going on, but the circuit will be ready. There's no doubt about that.
""The Paddock Club (hospitality), the 48 pit buildings, medical centre, team buildings - all of those are in place.
""Everything that is required to run a Formula One race here is in place which includes 674 light poles and goodness knows what else.""
Michael Masi, the Formula One race director, arrived in Jeddah on Tuesday to see the progress for what will be a floodlit night event.
Whitaker said the last metres of asphalt were being laid after a delay of a couple of days due to heavy rain in the Red Sea port city, a downpour that also alleviated any concern about drainage.
""The magnitude and scope and scale of this facility is quite remarkable. It's extraordinary. They started building this in May,"" said Whitaker.
""In normal circumstances organising the first race in a new country you would probably give yourself 18 months just to organise it.""

The last of three races on successive weekends from Mexico via Brazil, Qatar also starts a final run of three in the Middle East to decide whether Mercedes' Hamilton wins a record eighth championship or Red Bull's Verstappen takes his first.
Hamilton slashed the gap to 14 points after overcoming a series of setbacks with one of his finest career victories at Sao Paulo's Interlagos circuit last Sunday.
Brazil was marked by suspicion and controversy, and that is set to continue at the 20th race of the season with Mercedes seeking a stewards' review of a defensive move by Verstappen that forced Hamilton off track.
Meanwhile, fans will be on tenterhooks for the next instalment of the battle between two adversaries driving hard and at their best.
""We’re seeing a titanic battle for this year’s two championships, and the race in Brazil was just another twist in an engrossing tale,"" said Formula One's managing director Ross Brawn.
""Mercedes had the edge (in Brazil), but it could swing back into Red Bull’s favour next time. It’s been fantastic. No one knows what will happen next.""
Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said his team would come out fighting.
""The final race of a triple-header can sometimes test your energy levels but with just three races to decide both championships, our motivation is greater than ever,"" added the Austrian.
""Our focus is on channelling it in the most effective way.""
Mercedes are 11 points clear of Red Bull in the constructors' championship.
Qatar's Losail circuit near Doha has regularly hosted MotoGP's season-opening race and is fast and flowing with a mix of medium and high-speed corners and a one km long main straight.
It will be followed by another new venue in Saudi Arabia, a street circuit in Jeddah, before the final in Abu Dhabi where changes have been made to the track since the last time Formula One raced there.
""I think I’ve only been to Qatar once for a prize giving so I’m looking forward to going back,"" said Verstappen. ""Hopefully we can perform well there. It always looks cool when we see MotoGP race there.""
Verstappen's Mexican team mate Sergio Perez has raced previously at Losail, having won there in the GP2 Asia series in 2009.
Alpine racing director Davide Brivio has far more experience, having joined the Renault-owned team from MotoGP champions Suzuki last January.

Lap distance: 5.38km. Total distance: 306.66km (57 laps)
No previous race held there.
Start time: 1400GMT/1700 local
QATAR
The circuit has hosted MotoGP since 2004, becoming a night race in 2008 when it also opened the season.
Qatar has signed a 10-year deal to host Formula One from 2023, after the 2022 soccer World Cup. A new circuit could be used from then.
The 5.4km Losail layout is fast and flowing and features 16 medium and high-speed corners. 
The main straight is more than one km long and the surface is expected to be abrasive, which could mean high tyre wear. Overtaking could be tricky, with only one zone for the drag reduction system (DRS) to operate in.
Weather conditions will be warm and similar to what teams are used to in Abu Dhabi.    
Qatar will be the 36th country to host Formula One. 
RACE WINS
Hamilton has a record 101 career victories, of which 80 have been with Mercedes, from 285 starts. He has been on the podium 179 times.
Red Bull's championship leader Max Verstappen has won nine times this year to Hamilton's six. Red Bull's Sergio Perez, Alpine's Esteban Ocon, McLaren's Daniel Ricciardo and Mercedes' Bottas have each won once.
Ferrari have won 238 races since 1950, McLaren 183, Mercedes 122, Williams 114 and Red Bull 74.
POLE POSITION
Hamilton has a record 101 career poles and has won 59 times from pole. Team mate Valtteri Bottas has had four poles in 2021.
Verstappen has been on pole nine times in 2021, while Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was fastest in Azerbaijan and Monaco qualifying. McLaren's Lando Norris was on pole in Russia.
CHAMPIONSHIP
Verstappen is 14 points ahead of Hamilton. Mercedes lead Red Bull by 11 points.
MILESTONE
Red Bull have won 10 races this season, more than when they won the title in 2010 in 2012. They won 12 in 2011 and 13 in 2013, a number they can still match.
Hamilton and Bottas have now won 58 races as Mercedes team mates, matching the record set by Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello at Ferrari from 2000-05.
Hamilton's 101st career win came in Brazil and matched the total tally of all Brazilian drivers in Formula One history: Ayrton Senna 41, Nelson Piquet 23, Emerson Fittipaldi 14, Barrichello and Felipe Massa 11 each, Carlos Pace 1.

Damon Hill, the 1996 world champion, told Sky Sports television that Verstappen had used ""every bit of road he possibly could"" to keep Hamilton behind.
""At the time I thought that was a penalty but I think the other way of looking at it is that you let things run their course.

City will start their campaign against Brisbane Roar on Friday at Melbourne Rectangular Stadium where they celebrated their first championship in June with an emphatic 3-1 win over league heavyweights Sydney FC.
""There's always room for improvement in every area. We need to push harder,"" former Australia and Leicester defender Kisnorbo told reporters on Thursday.
""I'll try to be a better coach, manager and person.
""I'll make mistakes but hopefully I'll learn from them.""
The A-League has had a rocky two years through the COVID-19 pandemic, with huge disruptions to the schedule and clubs chased from their home bases for months at a time due to lockdowns.
The disruptions strained the league's relationship with its previous broadcaster Fox Sports and sent much of the game's international talent packing for home.
Now starting a new five-year deal with ViacomCBS and fully managed by the clubs, the A-League will launch with an air of optimism and a dash of free-to-air action after some 16 years of operating completely behind a pay-wall.
League bosses hope a bigger marketing splash by the new broadcaster will help lure fans back to stadiums as COVID-19 restrictions fall away.
""The players are excited just to play but the supporters and football lovers are obviously excited with everything else that's happening,"" said Kisnorbo.
""If our game expands and gets better and gets more people to stadiums, that's what we want.""
Backed by the oil and private equity wealth of its City Football Group ownership, Melbourne finally found their winning formula in the 2020/21 season after years of flirting with the silverware.
They have high hopes of going back-to-back, after adding seasoned Australia winger Mathew Leckie to an attacking arsenal already featuring twice Golden Boot winner Jamie Maclaren.
With Australia opening up after 18 months of closed borders, the league will also welcome the return of international glamour.
Former Liverpool and England striker Daniel Sturridge is set to revive his career with Perth Glory when they host Adelaide United on Saturday after spending two weeks in hotel quarantine.
""It’s about getting match-fit now and being in football shape again,"" Sturridge said this week.

Ntamack played at inside centre in test wins over Argentina and Georgia earlier this month to allow coach Fabien Galthie to field Matthieu Jalibert in the number 10 jersey. The latter drops to the bench.
""We had two tests to try this association (of Ntamack and Jalibert) out and after a dozen training sessions and those two tests, we've decided to change our lineup,"" Galthie told reporters on Thursday.
""Gael Fickou and Jonathan Danty have a lot of experience together at centre and Romain and Antoine also have experience together. So we picked that formula to start the game. It's a performance-oriented choice, not a choice by default.""
Danty takes Ntamack's place among the centres, where he will partner Fickou, while the back three is made up of wings Gabin Villiere and Damian Penaud, with Melvyn Jaminet at fullback.
France could revert to their tactics of abandoning possession, a strategy Galthie implements to ""find space"".
""Sometimes it makes sense to abandon possession, sometimes it's the most intelligent thing to do. Our goal is to catch the opponents' defence by surprise, make them feel like they have no guarantees.""
Francois Cros comes into the loose forwards in place of Sekou Makalou, with Anthony Jelonch switching from the number six to seven jersey and Gregory Alldritt at the back of the scrum.
""We have good balance in the third row,"" said Galthie. ""They're experienced players with a lot of character.""
Paul Willemse is recalled at lock to partner Cameron Woki, while the front row is made up of props Uini Atonio and Cyril Baille, and hooker Peato Mauvaka, who was handed a place in the starting lineup following a brilliant performance against Georgia after he replaced the injured Julien Marchand.
France have beaten Argentina 29-20 and Georgia 41-15 in the autumn series, but Saturday's challenge will be a considerable step up.
Their last home win against the All Blacks was a 42-33 victory in Marseille in 2000, while their previous win in Paris came in 1973.
New Zealand lost 29-20 against Ireland last weekend but Galthie insisted Les Bleus would not copy the Irish.
""It was a different game... we're France, not Ireland,"" he said. ""We have our own history that we've started two years ago. Our opponents won't be the same ones who were in Dublin last year.""

Hamilton's Mercedes team have requested a review of the incident, with stewards hearing representatives of both teams on Thursday ahead of this weekend's Qatar Grand Prix to decide how to proceed.
The governing FIA said the stewards would publish their decision on Friday.
Both drivers went off track as Verstappen defended, with Mercedes feeling the Dutch youngster should have had a time penalty. 
Hamilton ultimately overtook his rival anyway and won the race at Interlagos.
Verstappen, now 14 points ahead of the seven times world champion, said last Sunday's race had been a good battle between the two contenders.
Asked whether he would repeat the move in the same circumstances against Hamilton, Verstappen replied: ""Yes. 
""As a driver I think we know exactly what we can or cannot do in a car, and we were fighting hard, braking late into the corner, the tyres were quite worn. If I would have turned more abrupt to the left, you'd just spin off the track.""
The 24-year-old said he was not worried about a retrospective time penalty that would cost him points.
""I don't even think about that,"" he said. ""Also - if if if. I mean, it's not the end of the world. But again, I don't expect that to happen because I thought it was fair, hard racing between the two guys who are fighting for the championship.
""So it wouldn't have been anyway an easy pass, because that's not how I am and I don't think how it should be when you're fighting for the title.""
Verstappen was asked also whether he had seen the video footage from his own car's forward-facing camera, images that were not available at the time to stewards.
""I didn't need to look at the footage because I was driving the car,"" he replied. 
Hamilton told reporters separately that he was focusing on the weekend ahead.
""I've literally just tried to give all my energy to getting ready for this weekend, making sure we arrive and hit the ground running,"" he said.
""I have no idea where they're going with the discussion or what could be the outcome.""

""You want that in your boss, someone that's out there go-getting and pushing and chasing every millisecond and with you along the way. I love that he stands for what he thinks is right. We've grown hugely closer over these years.""
Wolff lit up social media when he angrily pointed a finger at the television camera after Hamilton took his 101st career win in Brazil.
He explained it afterwards by saying ""that was just a friendly hello at the race director"".
Hamilton had been sent to the back of the grid after qualifying for the Saturday sprint when his car failed a technical check, and started the main race 10th after an engine penalty.
Wolff was already in a Mercedes-against-the-world mood on Saturday when he swore over the radio to Hamilton after the Briton went from last to fifth in the sprint race.
He remained combative after the race, with Mercedes requesting a stewards' review of a defensive move by Red Bull's championship leader Max Verstappen that sent him and Hamilton off track.

The Welshman needs to overturn a 17-point deficit - with 30 still to be won - in the Monza finale to become only the third Briton to take the title and the first since the late Richard Burns in 2001.
A year ago he arrived in Monza with a 14-point advantage but crashed out. This time Ogier need only finish third even if Evans wins.
""We know obviously that we have much less of a chance to clinch the title on Sunday, so in way the pressure is off,"" Evans, a Red Bull athlete, told Reuters.
""Regardless of whether Seb has some bad luck or makes a mistake or anything this weekend, I still have a 17 point deficit to make up. You need a pretty good rally to rack up those sort of points so our focus is purely on that.
""It’s just another rally as far as I’m concerned,"" he added.  ""It’s the last rally with the cars that we have now so we’ll just enjoy it as much as possible and see what happens.""
That said, Monza is far from just another rally with the weekend marking the end of an era for the sport in more ways than one.
Ogier is stepping back from full-time racing and entering only selected championship rallies next season as the sport begins a new hybrid era.
A Frenchman called Sebastien has won all but one of the last 17 championships, with Sebastien Loeb taking nine in a row before Ogier took up the baton. Estonian Ott Tanak, in 2019, is the sole exception.
""It’s been a long time of French domination and obviously they’ve both achieved a pretty incredible amount of statistics and results throughout their career,"" said Evans, 32.
""Everybody’s been raising the game to try and beat him and I think it’s done a lot of good in the sense of the competitiveness of the sport. Now there’s a lot of drivers who can win rallies and want to fight for the title also.""
As at the end of the Michael Schumacher era in Formula One,  beating an all-time great carries a special kudos and Evans has no sense of relief at Ogier's departure.
""If you want to be world champion then you have to beat the best... he has been the benchmark and in a way it would be sweet to have won it if he was still here and we were able to beat him. I would rather win one with him here than without him.""

""The track's quite nice, no real issues. At the moment I'm a little bit slow so I need to figure that out tonight.""

457,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/f1-stewards-reject-mercedes-request-review-2326011,F1 stewards reject Mercedes request for review,"Formula 1 stewards rejected on Friday (Nov 19) a Mercedes request to review a decision not to penalise Red Bull's championship leader Max Verstappen for a Sao Paulo Grand Prix incident with Lewis Hamilton.
They said in a statement ahead of the Qatar Grand Prix that while Mercedes had presented new and relevant video evidence from Interlagos, it was not significant.
""The competitor’s position is that this new footage provides sufficient information for the stewards to come to an altogether different conclusion than they did previously,"" they explained.
""However, the stewards determine that the footage shows nothing exceptional that is particularly different from the other angles that were available to them at the time, or that particularly changes their decision.""
To meet the conditions for a Right of Review under the sporting code, a team must present evidence that is significant, relevant, new and that was previously unavailable to the parties concerned.
Seven-time world champion Hamilton won the race at Interlagos last Sunday to cut Verstappen's overall lead to 14 points with three races remaining.
The pair went off track on lap 48 as Hamilton tried to pass and Verstappen defended aggressively in a move that the Briton's Mercedes team felt should have drawn a time penalty for the Dutch youngster.
Had they done so retrospectively, Verstappen risked losing more points.
The stewards took note of the incident during the race but concluded, on the basis of the evidence they had, that no investigation was necessary.
They heard from Mercedes, who lead Red Bull in the constructors' standings by 11 points, and Verstappen's team at the Losail circuit on Thursday.
Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said the decision was completely expected.
""We wanted to trigger discussion around it,"" he told reporters. ""I think that objective is achieved. We didn't really think it would go any further.""
Red Bull boss Christian Horner said it was the right outcome.
""It would have opened Pandora's box regarding a whole bunch of other incidents that happened at that race,"" he said.",['457_0'],"[""\nFormula One F1 - Qatar Grand Prix - Losail International Circuit, Lusail, Qatar - November 19, 2021  Red Bull's Max Verstappen during practice REUTERS/Thaier Al-Sudani\n""]"
456,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/red-bull-ready-protest-mercedes-rear-wing-says-horner-2326331,"Red Bull ready to protest Mercedes rear wing, says Horner","    Red Bull are concerned about the legality of the rear wing used by Formula One rivals Mercedes and will protest if they see something suspicious at this weekend's Qatar Grand Prix, principal Christian Horner said on Friday.
Horner was speaking after stewards rejected a Mercedes request to review a decision not to punish Red Bull's championship leader Max Verstappen for an incident with Lewis Hamilton at the previous race in Brazil.
Mercedes boss Toto Wolff, whose team lead Red Bull by 11 points in the constructors' championship, told reporters earlier on Friday that the gloves were off in the title battle between the two teams.
Red Bull have long had suspicions about the Mercedes rear wing, with Verstappen feeling it with his hands after a Saturday sprint race in Brazil, earning himself a 50,000 euro  (US$56,545) fine.
Asked whether he suspected the wing was ""somehow dumping drag even with the drag reduction system closed at certain high speeds"", with 'score marks' from flexing apparently visible on the end-plates, Horner told Sky Sports television:
""There's very specific regulations about this. And obviously the directives that came out prior to Azerbaijan (in June) had a material effect. 
""I think this is something even more advanced... it's hidden in the way that it operates so that it's harder to spot from a camera.
""But you can see the straight line performance since Hungary (in August), and particularly in the last two grands prix, has gone exponential. And I think that obviously concerns us.""
Horner said Red Bull technical head Adrian Newey and chief engineer Paul Monaghan had been discussing the matter with the governing body.
The FIA introduced new flexibility tests after Azerbaijan following suspicions some teams were bending the rules with wings that passed static inspection but worked differently at speed.
Asked whether Red Bull were prepared to protest, Horner replied: ""Make no bones about it, if we see it on the car here it will be protested.""
Horner said the wing was likely to be less of a factor in Qatar than at Saudi Arabia's Jeddah street circuit and Abu Dhabi, the last two races of the season.
""You could have a situation like Brazil where the car (Mercedes) is quite simply unraceable,"" he said of his rivals'  straight line speed.
Verstappen leads seven times world champion Hamilton by 14 points ahead of Sunday's race.

Gay sex is punishable by jail in Qatar, as in many Muslim-majority countries. 
The conservative Gulf Arab state is hosting a Formula One grand prix for the first time this weekend and has signed a 10-year contract from 2023.
Hamilton's helmet featured the words ""We Stand Together"" on the back and reflected the colours of the Progress Pride flag with a chevron to represent the intersex community as well as LGBTQ+.
""This is what we mean when we talk about using your platform for good and carrying your values with you,"" said Racing Pride co-founder Richard Morris on Twitter.
""The symbolism of this, in one of the world’s most dangerous regions for LGBTQ+ people, is enormously powerful. I can’t even express my admiration for Lewis today.""   
In July Hamilton spoke out against Hungary's anti-LGBTQ+ legislation ahead of the country's grand prix and urged voters to protect rights by rejecting it in a coming referendum.
The sport's most successful driver of all time, with a record 101 wins, has used his platform to promote diversity and campaign for human rights.
The title contender told reporters at the Losail circuit on Thursday that while it was not up to the drivers where they raced, he was aware of the situation.
""I do feel that there are issues in these places that we are going to, as there are around the world, but of course (this) seems to be deemed as one of the worst in this part of the world,"" said the Briton.
""I do think as these sports go to these places they are duty bound to raise awareness for these issues and these places need scrutiny and need the media to speak about these things. Equal rights is a serious issue.
""However I am aware that in this place they are trying to make steps and it can't change overnight.""

By Alan Baldwin
    Mercedes Formula One team boss Toto Wolff declared the gloves were off as he and Red Bull rival Christian Horner engaged in more verbal sparring at the inaugural Qatar Grand Prix on Friday.
The two principals have been needling each other all season amid the ebbs and flows of the title battle and they appeared together in a scheduled news conference between practice sessions at Losail.
The fighting talk came to the fore again, following on from last weekend's race in Brazil that was overshadowed by suspicions and accusations.
Asked whether there was still mutual respect ahead of the final three races, Wolff replied: ""There are many great people working in Red Bull and obviously many in Mercedes and it's a hell of a fight.
""There is a respect for the capability that Red Bull has, definitely, and it's clear that this is tough. It's the world championship of the highest category in motor racing and what started as Olympic boxing went to pro boxing and is now MMA.
""Gloves are off and nothing else is to be expected.""
Horner, asked for his view, replied bluntly: ""There is no relationship.""
Defining it as ""the most intense political title fight"" the team had ever experienced, he said relationship and respect were different things and he respected the achievements of Mercedes and seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton.
""But I don't need to go to dinner with Toto, I don't need to kiss his arse or anything like that. There's a few other team principals who might...""
Horner, who recently compared Wolff to a 'pantomime dame' after being labelled a 'windbag' before that by the Austrian, said they were just very different characters.
""Am I going to be spending Christmas with Toto? Probably not, unless you're in panto this year? I might take the kids,""  added the Briton.
""You don't have to be best mates with your opponents. How can you be? I think that would be dishonest to fake a facade when you're competing against each other.""
Mercedes are 11 points clear of Red Bull in the constructors' championship but Red Bull's Max Verstappen is 14  ahead of Hamilton.

The Welshman completed the seventh stage of the Monza Rally with a 1.4 second advantage over the Frenchman, who is chasing his eighth world championship in nine years and enjoys a 17 point lead.
Hyundai's Thierry Neuville was in third place, 20.2 seconds further behind.
Evans is the only driver who can deny Ogier the title but he has played down his chances, saying before the start that he would just treat it like any other rally and go out to do his best.
Ogier led after the first four foggy stages in the Italian Alps but Evans went ahead at the Monza circuit, home to the country's Formula One Grand Prix, in the afternoon when the Frenchman had brake problems.
The day finished in the dark and on slippery asphalt.
""It’s been a good start,"" said Ogier. ""I think we had a good drive in the mountains. This afternoon I had some little issues and I didn’t take any risks in the last stage with the chicanes.
""I’m happy where I am right now. Elfyn is not a fight I need to take on.""
Evans must win with Ogier outside the top three to become the first British world rally champion since the late Richard Burns in 2001.

Red Bull's championship leader Max Verstappen, who is 14 points clear of Hamilton with three races remaining in the Middle East, was third fastest but 0.341 seconds off the pace set by Bottas.
Bottas, who has taken three pole positions in the last four races and lapped fastest in Friday practice, put in a best time of one minute 22.310 seconds and was 0.078 quicker than Hamilton.
Verstappen did fewer laps than Hamilton after losing time as Red Bull worked on his car's fluttering rear wing - a topical issue after the team made accusations about apparent wing flexing on Hamilton's Mercedes. 
AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly, who was consistently fast on Friday, was fourth with Verstappen's team mate Sergio Perez fifth.
Russian rookie Nikita Mazepin, who missed Friday's second session as his Haas team changed the chassis, had another frustrating session and again failed to set a time with the engine control unit and loom needing to be replaced.

Red Bull's championship leader Max Verstappen, 14 points clear of his British rival with three races remaining, qualified  a distant second but faces a stewards' enquiry before Sunday's  race and risks a grid drop.
Hamilton's team mate Valtteri Bottas, fastest in practice, ended up third but was also summoned for allegedly not respecting warning flags.
""That last lap was beautiful, it was a really sweet lap,"" said Hamilton, who won last weekend in Brazil after starting 10th on the grid.
The defending champion was first out of the pits for the final flying effort and set an eye-opening time of one minute 20.827 seconds for his 102nd career pole and fourth of the season.
The 36-year-old had already been on provisional pole with a time of 1:21.262 after going fastest in the first and second phases of qualifying and also being quickest in every sector of the track.
The margin of 0.455 between the two title contenders was the biggest it had been all season in a qualifying session in dry conditions.
Hamilton said he had not been feeling well on Thursday and Friday, when he was also up until midnight working with his engineers.
""I had a bit of a stomach ache from Wednesday but felt fantastic today. I slept well last night so that makes a big difference,"" he said.
LACKING PACE
Verstappen, whose team have openly questioned the legality of Hamilton's rear wing and voiced concern about the Mercedes' impressive straight line speed, said his car was just lacking some pace.
""It's been just a bit more tricky for us again in qualifying,"" said the Dutch 24-year-old, whose Mexican team mate Sergio Perez qualified only 11th in a strategic setback for Red Bull.
""Checo (Perez) is not even in Q3 (the final phase) so it definitely shows we are struggling a bit more than normal. But nevertheless it's still second, so it's all to play for. I wish we could have fought for more.""
Pierre Gasly was fourth despite breaking his front wing on the kerbs and suffering a puncture, shedding debris and bringing out the yellow flags briefly on his final lap as he came to a halt.
Verstappen's summons was for allegedly failing to slow for the waved double yellows. 
Double world champion Fernando Alonso qualified fifth for Renault-owned Alpine, with McLaren's Lando Norris sixth and Carlos Sainz seventh for Ferrari - although he too was summoned to see the stewards for a potential flag breach.
""I think there are certain circuits that seem to be better for our package and this is one of those,"" said Alonso, whose team are level on points with AlphaTauri but ahead thanks to a race win.
""Being at night, I know it should be no big difference but the track is quite cool at night and that helps a lot with the overheating of the tyres,"" added the Spaniard. 
""You feel the grip, you feel you can drive the car, you don't need to save the tyres in any of the corners and that's a good feeling for a driver.""   
AlphaTauri's Yuki Tsunoda, Alpine's Esteban Ocon and Aston Martin's Sebastian Vettel completed the top 10.
Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and McLaren's Daniel Ricciardo start 13th and 14th respectively with their teams battling for third overall.

The seven-times world champion said a lengthy drivers' meeting with race director Michael Masi at the Qatar Grand Prix provided no clarification on overtaking and what would be seen as 'hard and fair racing' and what would be penalised.
""No. It's not clear. Every driver I think, except for Max, was asking about it just for clarity. But it wasn't very clear,"" Hamilton told reporters.
""It's still not clear what the limits of the track are. It's clearly not the white line any more, when overtaking. So we just go for it.
""We just ask for consistency. So if it's the same as the last race then that should be the same for all of us in those scenarios.""
Hamilton, who had to run completely off track at Interlagos as Verstappen defended against an overtaking move by braking late and also going wide, said there was no assurance on consistency.
""It's not clear. It could be different with different stewards, is what they said,"" he added.
Verstappen, who leads Hamilton by 14 points, said the situation was ultimately ""pretty clear"" and felt there was no need to discuss details in the media.
Mercedes boss Toto Wolff told Sky Sports television that the stewards taking no action against Verstappen's aggressive defence in Sao Paulo could have repercussions.
Mercedes had tried to force a review of the stewards' decision not to penalise Verstappen but were denied on grounds that new video evidence was not significant.
""In my opinion, what it says is you can just launch yourself into a corner and drag the other car out of line. And that obviously can lead to quite some dirtier driving going forward,"" said Wolff.
""We don’t want to have a messy situation tomorrow, in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, because that would be really bad.""

The Dutch 24-year-old qualified second, with title rival Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes on pole position.
Stewards said in a statement that Verstappen and a team representative must report to them at 1300 local time on Sunday. The floodlit night race is due to start at 1700.
The yellow warning flags - under which drivers must reduce speed significantly and be prepared to stop - were double waved after AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly lost his front wing and suffered a puncture, stopping on track.
Verstappen completed his final lap after Gasly's incident and improved his qualifying time.
He leads seven-times world champion Hamilton by 14 points with three races remaining.
Ferrari's Carlos Sainz, who was seventh on the provisional grid, was also summoned to the stewards at 1330 local for allegedly not respecting a single-waved yellow.
Aston Martin four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel said he had slowed for yellow flags and lost out as a result.
""I don’t know if it was a single yellow or double yellow, but if there’s a car standing on track, then it should be a double yellow. And double yellows are ‘abort the lap’ so I lifted. Maybe I was the only one,"" he told reporters.
The German also suggested Verstappen had been helped by the signalling.
""It’s a bit of a shame because I had the yellow flag in the last sector and then the yellow flag cleared, I guess, because Max was coming,"" he said.

Verstappen, 24, had qualified on the front row with seven- times world champion Hamilton taking pole position for Mercedes but the Dutch driver will now start seventh.
AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly joins Hamilton on the front row instead, while Bottas drops to sixth due to Verstappen's penalty.
The governing FIA initially placed Bottas fifth but changed that on the final grid.
Verstappen is 14 points clear of Hamilton with three races remaining. Defending champions Mercedes lead Red Bull by 11 points in the constructors' standings.
In another stewards' decision, Ferrari's Carlos Sainz was cleared of an alleged flag breach and no further action was taken. The Spaniard moved up to fifth on the grid.  
The stewards found that Verstappen had failed to respect double yellow waved flags after AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly had stopped on the pit straight with a broken front wing and puncture.
Verstappen also had two penalty points imposed, taking his tally to four for a 12-month period.
Red Bull had sought to mitigate the penalty because trackside light panels were not showing the yellow warning, there was no in-car warning light and no audio signal from team to the driver.
The stewards said they had ""sympathy"" for the request but the rules stated the driver had to drive the car unaided while  flags and lights carried equal weight.
They pointed out that Hamilton had been handed a three-place drop in Austria last season for breaching a single flag warning while Sebastian Vettel was given a five-place penalty in Bahrain this year for a double-flag offence.
""Accordingly, the stewards believe they have no option but to impose the standard penalty for a breach of the double yellow flag requirements,"" a statement said.

Double world champion Fernando Alonso was third for Renault-owned Alpine, the 40-year-old Spaniard's first podium finish since he was second in the 2014 Hungarian Grand Prix with Ferrari.
""It was pretty straightforward, it was pretty lonely at the front,"" said Hamilton, who led from pole position and was never challenged over the 57 laps of the floodlit night race that finished under virtual safety car conditions.
""Of course, I enjoy those races where you're battling through but we needed those points today, so I think a real solid job from the team... Bring on the next two.""
The win was Hamilton's seventh from 20 races this season, second in a row, and the record-extending 102nd of his career also continued his strong pedigree at new circuits on the calendar.
The Briton took the chequered flag, waved by Qatar's Olympic high jump champion Mutaz Barshim, a hefty 25.743 seconds ahead of Verstappen.
Verstappen, who has nine wins this year, carried out another solid piece of damage limitation as Red Bull cut Mercedes lead in the constructors' standings from 11 to five points.
""Of course, our starting position was a bit compromised but luckily we had a really good start,"" said Verstappen, who was fourth by the end of the opening lap and up to second after the fifth.
""I know it's going to be difficult to the end but that keeps it exciting. It's going to be a tight battle until the end.""
The Dutch 24-year-old can still win the championship with a race to spare at the next race in Saudi Arabia if Hamilton fails to score.
Team boss Christian Horner will have to watch his language then after collecting an official warning from stewards for referring to a ""rogue marshal"" in a heated reaction to Verstappen's penalty.
Mexican Sergio Perez was fourth for Red Bull with Frenchman Esteban Ocon fifth for Alpine in a race livened up by a spate of punctures late on among those trying to make a single pitstop work.
They included Hamilton's team mate Valtteri Bottas, who was the only driver still to pit when his front left deflated after 33 laps.
The Finn, who also had a three-place grid penalty, pitted from third place and returned in 14th with a new front wing and set of hard tyres. He was then told to retire from 12th with 10 laps to go.
Lance Stroll took sixth for Aston Martin, ahead of the Ferrari pairing of Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc. Lando Norris finished ninth for McLaren and Sebastian Vettel 10th for Aston Martin.
Williams pair George Russell and Nicholas Latifi suffered late punctures, with the latter parking up beside the track and triggering the virtual safety car, rendering needless a final Verstappen stop for fresh tyres to be sure of fastest lap.

The Briton apologised after the race and also agreed to participate in an international stewards' programme next February.
Verstappen was given a five-place grid penalty, dropping him from the front row to seventh, after he failed to slow for waved yellow warning flags on his flying lap at the end of Saturday's qualifying.
The Dutch 24-year-old ended the race in second place, his lead over Mercedes' seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton cut to eight points with two races remaining in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi.
Red Bull are five points behind Mercedes in the constructors' standings.
The stewards said in a statement that the marshal concerned was ""doing his job in precisely the manner prescribed in the International Sporting Code.""
Horner, who made his original comments to Sky Sports television before the race, returned to the broadcaster after the hearing to make an apology.
""I'd like to make it clear that marshals do a wonderful, wonderful job,"" he said.
""They are volunteers, they do a great job. My frustration in what I voiced earlier wasn't at marshals, it was at a circumstance.
""If any offence was taken by any individual then obviously I apologise for that.""
Horner and his Mercedes counterpart Toto Wolff have been engaged in verbal sparring for much of the season but the Briton denied he was feeling the pressure in the intensity of the championship battle.
""I think we've actually been pretty good with our emotions,"" he said. ""I haven't been pointing and swearing at cameras and that kind of thing.""",['444_0'],['\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner is seen during practice. (Photo: REUTERS/Benoit Tessier)\n']
443,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/alonso-back-f1-podium-after-record-seven-year-gap-2329431,Alonso back on the F1 podium after record seven-year gap,"Fernando Alonso had feared he might never stand on a Formula One podium again until the inaugural Qatar Grand Prix ended a record seven-year wait on Sunday and saw the double world champion hailed as driver of the day.
The 40-year-old Spaniard finished third at the Losail circuit for Renault-owned Alpine to cap his comeback season after two years out.
The last time Alonso stood on the podium was as a Ferrari driver in Hungary in 2014, when he finished second, and the 105 races between successive podiums was the longest gap yet for the sport.
To put the wait into perspective, the last time fans saw Alonso on the podium was before Red Bull's current 24-year-old championship leader Max Verstappen - second on Sunday - made his Formula One debut.
""Finally. We were very close on a few occasions and I was just wondering if I will get one podium again in my career, or not,"" said Alonso. ""You never know what is going to happen next year.
""I'm happy that we took this one and let's see if we can keep the momentum for next year.""
Alonso won his titles with Renault in 2005 and 2006 and has 32 wins to his credit - putting him sixth on the all-time list - with the last coming in 2013 when he finished runner-up in the championship with Ferrari.
He moved to McLaren in 2015 in what turned out to be a nightmare partnership with Honda and left at the end of 2018 - going off and winning the Le Mans 24 Hours twice and competing in the Dakar Rally and Indianapolis 500.
He returned to F1 this year with renewed energy at the renamed Renault team.
While French team mate Esteban Ocon took a surprise victory in Hungary in August, Alonso's fourth in that same race was his best showing so far this season.
He started third on Sunday after Verstappen took a five-place grid penalty and Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas dropped three from third.
Alonso made a strong start to seize second place from AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly, before ceding to Verstappen, and dropped to fourth until Red Bull's Sergio Perez pitted and he stayed out.
An anxious late phase on worn tyres was then eased by a virtual safety car.
""Seven years, but finally we got it,"" he said before celebrating with former McLaren team mate Lewis Hamilton, now a seven-times world champion at Mercedes, who took his 102nd career win. ""I was waiting so long for this. I am happy.""",['443_0'],"[""\nAlpine's Fernando Alonso during the press conference after the race. (Photo: FIA/Handout via REUTERS)\n""]"
442,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/team-team-analysis-qatar-grand-prix-2329611,Team by team analysis of the Qatar Grand Prix,"    Team by team analysis of Sunday's Qatar Grand Prix, the 20th race of the 22-round Formula One world championship (listed in current order):
MERCEDES (Lewis Hamilton 1, Valtteri Bottas retired)
Hamilton led from pole to take his 102nd career victory and seventh of the season. He is now eight points behind Verstappen. This was the 30th circuit he was won at. Bottas started sixth, after a three place penalty for failing to respect warning flags in qualifying, and dropped to 11th at the start. He had a front-left puncture on lap 33, limped back to the pits but retired on lap 48 due to the damage. Mercedes are now only five points clear of Red Bull.
RED BULL (Max Verstappen 2, Sergio Perez 4)
Verstappen started seventh, after a five place grid penalty for failing to slow for yellow flags in qualifying, but was fourth at the end of lap one and second after five laps. He took a bonus point for fastest lap. Perez started 11th and might have been on the podium but for a switch to two stops and then the virtual safety car. Team boss Horner was handed an official warning for comments about a marshal, and apologised.    
FERRARI (Carlos Sainz 7, Charles Leclerc 8) 
Sainz started fifth after penalties for Bottas and Verstappen and did a one stop strategy. Both Ferrari drivers had to do a lot of tyre management. Leclerc started with a new chassis in 13th place. Ferrari double-stacked the drivers at the pitstop. They now lead McLaren by 39.5 points.    
MCLAREN (Lando Norris 9, Daniel Ricciardo 12)
Norris started fourth and had good pace until a puncture wrecked his race and dropped him down from fourth with seven laps to go. The hard tyre that went in the second stint had done fewer laps than the soft in the first. Ricciardo started 14th, had a good first stint and then had to save fuel.
ALPINE (Fernando Alonso 3, Esteban Ocon 5) 
Alonso secured his first podium since 2014, when he was at Ferrari. He started third after penalties to Verstappen and Bottas and was second after the first corner but could not ultimately hold off Verstappen. He returned to third place after Perez pitted for a second time. Ocon moved up four places from his grid position. Renault-owned Alpine started the race level on points with AlphaTauri and are now 25 clear.  
ALPHATAURI (Pierre Gasly 11, Yuki Tsunoda 13)
Gasly started on the front row but lacked the speed to compete at the front. The team tried an aggressive two stop strategy but that did not work either. Tsunoda struggled on the soft tyre and was also slowed on the first stint when a visor tear-off became stuck on the rear wing, forcing an earlier pitstop to remove it.
ASTON MARTIN (Lance Stroll 6, Sebastian Vettel 10)
Stroll started 12th and made a strong start, undercutting Sainz at the pitstop. Both were on a one-stop. Vettel started 10th but dropped to 17th after being pushed wide by Bottas but made a strong recovery. This was the team's first double-points finish since France in June.
WILLIAMS (George Russell 17, Nicholas Latifi retired)
Latifi retired on lap 51 due to a puncture, bringing out the virtual safety car when he parked up by the side of the track and marshals had to come out to remove it. Russell started 15th and made an early stop on lap 17 and then had to pit again on lap 49 after a left-front puncture.
ALFA ROMEO (Kimi Raikkonen 14, Antonio Giovinazzi 15) 
Both did a two-stop strategy. Giovinazzi gained four places at the start.
HAAS (Mick Schumacher 16, Nikita Mazepin 18)
Schumacher started 19th and did a one-stop strategy, as did Mazepin, who had completed only 15 laps in practice and qualifying due to chassis problems.

441,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/verstappen-will-have-first-shot-f1-title-saudi-arabia-2330836,Verstappen will have first shot at F1 title in Saudi Arabia,"    Max Verstappen will have his first shot at clinching the Formula One title in Saudi Arabia in two weeks' time but Red Bull's championship leader could also see his advantage disappear entirely.
The 2021 title battle remains too close to call, with Mercedes' seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton closing the gap to eight points with another dominant win in Qatar on Sunday.
With two races remaining, the prospect of a winner-takes-all shootout in the final round at Abu Dhabi's Yas Marina is very much alive.
For Verstappen to clinch the title at the inaugural Saudi Grand Prix in Jeddah on Dec. 5, he must finish at least second.
But if Hamilton wins that race with a bonus point for fastest lap, and Verstappen is second, the pair will leave level on points and the Red Bull driver ahead 9-8 on race wins.
In that scenario, the title will be won by whoever finishes ahead of the other in the final race, unless they take each other out.
Should Hamilton win in Jeddah and Verstappen finish lower than second, it will be the Mercedes driver leading into the final race.
Other current title permutations all involve Verstappen finishing second in Jeddah, with or without fastest lap, but Hamilton failing to win.
A retirement for the Briton would still require Verstappen to score 18 points, a second place, to end the contest.
If Hamilton is 10th, Verstappen would need to be second with fastest lap.
Should Verstappen win, with fastest lap, it will be all over if Hamilton is no higher than sixth. Without fastest lap, Hamilton would have to be seventh or lower.
There have been plenty of ups and downs in this rollercoaster season, but the most probable outcome - based on form to date - is for the title race to go down to the wire.
Hamilton has failed to score in two of the 20 races so far, Azerbaijan and Italy, but Verstappen drew a blank in both as well - in Italy after they collided.
Verstappen has finished second seven times, with Hamilton the winner on six of those occasions.
The exception was Turkey, where Verstappen was second and Hamilton fifth.
In Monaco, Verstappen won with Hamilton seventh but the Briton made sure of fastest lap. On the two occasions where Verstappen has won with fastest lap, Hamilton finished second and fourth.
""It's going to be a tight battle to the end,"" said Verstappen, second on Sunday.

Team boss Frederic Vasseur told Reuters recently that Alfa were likely to have several drivers available as reserves.
French teenager Theo Pourchaire is under contract with Swiss-based Sauber, who run the team, and will do some Friday practice sessions while also competing in Formula Two.
""Next year will be again difficult with 23 races, plus the simulator plus the Pirelli test ... I think at the end to have two or three reserves is not too much,"" said Vasseur.
""With COVID, you need to have someone at the track (as a reserve). But if you want to do all the races and you can't do the simulator, you need to have two or three reserve drivers.""

The sport's chief executive Stefano Domenicali, a former boss of rivals Ferrari, paid tribute to the Englishman and said the F1 family had lost a ""much loved and respected member"".
""He was a true giant of our sport that overcame the most difficult of challenges in life and battled every day to win on and off the track,"" the Italian said in a statement.
""His incredible achievements and personality will be etched on our sport forever"".
Williams had been paralysed since 1986 when, at the age of 43, his rental car crashed as he was speeding away from the Le Castellet circuit in the south of France where his team was testing.
One of the longest-lived quadriplegics, he responded to the physical obstacles by steering his team to ever greater success as he watched from his wheelchair in the team garage.
""As I see it, I have had 40 fantastic years of one sort of life,"" he told his late wife Ginny after the accident. ""Now I shall have another 40 years of a different kind of life.""
In 2012 he handed over day-to-day running of the team to daughter Claire, even if she was always officially deputy-principal.
He was admitted to hospital on Friday and the British-based team said he ""passed away peacefully this morning surrounded by his family"".
Williams were sold to US-based Dorilton Capital last year and the family are no longer involved.
Under his leadership, the team won nine constructors' championships and seven drivers' titles, most recently with Canadian Jacques Villeneuve in 1997, and 114 grands prix - the last in 2012.
Only Ferrari have won more constructors' titles.
Australian Alan Jones, in 1980, was the first to win a drivers' title in a Williams and he was followed by Finland's Keke Rosberg in 1982.
Brazilian Nelson Piquet took his third title with the team in 1987, Britain's Nigel Mansell celebrated his one and only in 1992 before Frenchman Alain Prost chalked up the fourth of his career in 1993.
Damon Hill, who led the team on track after the death of triple champion Ayrton Senna in a Williams at Imola in 1994, won the title in 1996 before Villeneuve completed the list.
""Sir Frank gave me such a chance in my lifetime that I am indebted to him forever,"" said Hill. ""He was a very important person to my career and also a huge contributor to our sport.
""His record will stand for a very long time. As an individual team owner, as a team founder, there won't be another one again,"" Hill told Sky Sports. ""The only person I could compare him to is probably Enzo Ferrari.""
Seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton said he felt honoured to have called Williams a friend.
""What he achieved in this sport is something truly special. Until his last days I know he remained a racer and a fighter at heart. I have utmost respect and love for this man, and his legacy will live on forever,"" said the Mercedes driver.
Williams entered the sport in 1969, providing a Brabham for compatriot Piers Courage to race, and set up Williams Grand Prix Engineering in 1977 with co-founder Patrick Head.
In 1992, with a highly-innovative car designed by Adrian Newey, Williams won 10 of 16 races. In 1996, they won 12 of 16.","['437_0', '437_1', '437_2']","[""\n      FILE PHOTO: Williams Formula One team founder Frank Williams speaks during a party marking the team's 600th race, ahead of the British Grand Prix at the Silverstone Race circuit, central England, June 29, 2013.

Williams, who had been quadriplegic since a 1986 car accident in France, died on Sunday aged 79, his family said in a statement.
The eponymous team he founded, still the second most successful in terms of constructors' championships and third oldest, was sold to US-based Dorilton Capital last year.
Williams came from an era where title-winning teams were run by their founders, men such as Enzo Ferrari, Ken Tyrrell and Lotus boss Colin Chapman who are all long gone.
""Without those type of people I doubt whether Formula One would have still been going now. Probably Ferrari would have stopped and that would have been it,"" Ecclestone, 91, told Reuters.
""There’s not many of the old-timers floating around now - those that were with the teams when they started.
""You could buy an engine and a gearbox (in those days). You didn’t need to have multi, multi-billions and have 1,000 people working for you.""
Ecclestone, who took over and ran the Brabham team in the early 1970s, recalled Williams as an old friend who got over life's financial and physical obstacles with charm and determination.
""Frank was a little bit special as a person. And that sort of showed in the way he kept going,"" he said.
""Things were never really bad as far as Frank was concerned, he never complained about things. He got on with things the best way he could. And that’s the reason he was so successful. He was a racer through and through.""
Ecclestone recalled the obsessive physical fitness fanatic who before his accident would run for miles before dinner but also showed a keen eye for style.
""He was always ahead of the game. He knew about cashmere sweaters when I’d never heard of cashmere. That was Frank,"" said the British billionaire.
""He’d say to me 'Could you lend me 2,000 pounds'. And I’d say yes. And he’d say 'I’ll pay you in 10 days'. As sure as anything, Frank would return in 10 days with 2,000 pounds.
""He’d talk about whatever and then just before he went he’d say ‘I wonder if you could help me? Do you think you could lend me 2,500 pounds? I’ll pay you back in 10 days.’ And that’s how we worked with Frank. I would trust him with my life.""
Ecclestone also recalled sitting in hospital, after Williams had been flown back from France to London, with Formula One doctor Professor Sid Watkins.
""I said ‘How long’s this going to last?’ and he (Watkins) said ‘I think he’ll be here for six months looking at the ceiling’. I said ‘Is he going to survive all this?’ and he said ‘I don’t think so’. And Sid really knew (the science).

Raducanu competed in karting and motocross events as a child, and is a big fan of Formula One.
""(Hamilton) said: 'Be patient, you've just got to ride the wave. It's all good. Don't worry'. Good reassurance. He has been such a good role model for me in terms of helping me out through the next stages,"" Raducanu told British media.
The 19-year-old also shrugged off talk of beating Hamilton to the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award next month
""No, definitely not. I am rooting for Lewis in the race,"" she said.
""I just don't even think about it. For me, it's something that's so far out of the realms of possibility.""
Raducanu, who is preparing for the 2022 season by undergoing intense five-hour daily training sessions, also spoke about her personal goals.
""For me, my expectations of myself are to keep improving, I want to look back at the end of the year and see that I made gains in different areas. I know it will take a lot of patience to get to where I want to be,"" she said.
The match on Sunday was Raducanu's first on home soil since her astonishing U.S. Open triumph, when she entered the tournament as a qualifier ranked 150th in the world and ended it as Britain's first female Grand Slam champion for 44 years.

Qatar, preparing to host the World Cup in November-December next year, has also come under fire for labour conditions and the treatment of migrant workers.

431,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/hamilton-chasing-hat-trick-set-last-race-showdown-2351881,Hamilton chasing hat-trick to set up last-race showdown,"Red Bull's Max Verstappen has his first shot at winning the Formula One title in Sunday's inaugural Saudi Arabian Grand Prix but Mercedes rival Lewis Hamilton is chasing a hat-trick of wins to take the battle down to the wire in Abu Dhabi.
Seven-times world champion Hamilton, 36, has closed the gap to his 24-year-old rival to eight points in their clash of the generations after resounding back-to-back wins in Brazil and Qatar.
The championship has swung between the two and is now on a knife-edge.
Victory for Hamilton under the floodlights in the penultimate race of the season on Jeddah's super-fast 6.1km street circuit could catapult the Briton into the lead while a failure to finish is likely to end his hopes.
On paper the flat-out blasts along the Red Sea waterfront should favour Hamilton, whose Mercedes will once again have the ""spicy"" engine that powered the Briton from last on Saturday to first on Sunday in Brazil.
""Both titles are wide open, and our mission is clear,"" said Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff, whose team are five points ahead of Red Bull in the constructors' standings and can wrap up that battle if they score 40 points more than their rivals.
""The car has been performing well recently and is probably in the best place it has been all season, with the drivers confident to push it to the limit.""
Verstappen has won nine races to Hamilton's seven but has a tougher fight on his hands following Mercedes' recent performance improvement.
He needs to finish at least second to have a chance of wrapping up the title with a race to spare.
If Hamilton finishes fifth or higher, the championship remains open even if Verstappen scores maximum points for victory and fastest lap.
The Briton will, however, draw level on points with Verstappen if he wins and takes fastest lap even with the Dutchman second.
""I’m feeling calm, I know that I will always try to do the best that I can and we’ll just find out where we are going to end up,"" said Verstappen who made his Formula One debut in 2015 aged 17.
""Nothing has been decided yet and we are all up for the challenge, there’s still a lot of racing left to do and we are going to give it our all that’s for sure.""
Lower down the order, Ferrari could wrap up third place in the constructors' standings ahead of McLaren.
The Italians are 39.5 points clear of their Woking-based rivals with a maximum 44 points up for grabs after the race in Jeddah.
Formula One will also remember Frank Williams, former team principal and co-founder of the Williams outfit, who died on Sunday.
The team, the sport's third most successful in terms of wins, was sold to new owners last year but continues to race under the Williams name.","['431_0', '431_1']","[""\n      FILE PHOTO: Formula One F1 - Qatar Grand Prix - Losail International Circuit, Lusail, Qatar - November 21, 2021 Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton celebrates on the podium after winning the race REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed/Pool\n    "", ""\n      FILE PHOTO: Formula One F1 - Qatar Grand Prix - Losail International Circuit, Lusail, Qatar - November 21, 2021 Second placed Red Bull's Max Verstappen celebrates on the podium REUTERS/Thaier Al-Sudani\n    ""]"

The Red Bull driver has 351.5 points with Mercedes' seven= times world champion Lewis Hamilton eight points adrift on 343.5.
Hamilton has won the last two races, however, and heads into Sunday's race around the streets of Jeddah as favourite to take the title battle down to the wire in Abu Dhabi.
Points are awarded to the top 10 in 25-18-15-12-10-8-6-4-2-1 order with a bonus point for fastest lap.
That leaves a maximum 26 points to be won after this weekend.
VERSTAPPEN CAN BE CHAMPION IN SAUDI ARABIA IF:
He wins with fastest lap and Hamilton is outside the top five.
He wins without the fastest lap and Hamilton finishes outside the top six.
He finishes second with the fastest lap and Hamilton finishes lower than ninth.
He finishes second without the fastest lap and Hamilton fails to score.
If Verstappen finishes lower than second, the battle will stay alive into Abu Dhabi regardless of what Hamilton does.
LEVEL ON POINTS
If Hamilton wins and scores the extra point for fastest lap with Verstappen second, the pair will head into Abu Dhabi level  on points but with the Dutchman ahead on account of having won more races (9-8).
HAMILTON WILL TAKE THE LEAD IF:
He scores at least nine points more than Verstappen in Saudi Arabia, which includes victory with Verstappen third.

Not since 2012, when Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel faced Ferrari's Fernando Alonso in a final race title-decider in Brazil, has there been a run-in like the one between Max Verstappen and Mercedes' now seven times world champion Hamilton.
But this one is different, with eras to be ended and Formula One records beckoning.
""It's different because we've got two incredibly close teams, it's different because as a team we're fighting for uncharted territory,"" Hamilton told reporters on Thursday ahead of the season's penultimate race and first in Saudi Arabia.
""Nobody's ever won eight (successive) titles, team or driver.""
Mercedes have won the last seven drivers' and constructors' championships but this year could break the sport's longest period of domination by a single team and crown Verstappen for the first time.
Since 2012 the battle has gone the distance only twice and on both occasions it was between Hamilton and Mercedes team mate Nico Rosberg.
Verstappen needs to score 18 points more than Hamilton to end matters in Jeddah this weekend.
Otherwise the battle between the 24-year-old challenger and 36-year-old defending champion, a rivalry reminiscent of that in the late 1980s and early 1990s between Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, goes on to Abu Dhabi.
Mercedes can still make it eight constructors' crowns in a row but they would need to score 40 points more than Red Bull for that to happen this weekend.
Hamilton is eight points behind Verstappen. A victory with fastest lap in Jeddah for the Briton would see the pair go level on points if Verstappen is second.
Should they fail to score in Abu Dhabi, Verstappen would take it on wins.
That would be closer even than 1984, when Austrian Niki Lauda took his third title by half a point from eventual four times champion Prost.
The 1964 battle between Ferrari's John Surtees and BRM's Graham Hill ended with the former as champion by a single point despite his fellow-Briton scoring more overall. In those days, only the six best results counted.
In 1988 Senna won the first of his three titles despite also scoring fewer points than McLaren team mate Prost, with only the best 11 results counting.
In 2010 there were four contenders all the way to the final race with Vettel coming through despite not having led the championship until then.
Hamilton was one of them and already a veteran of such cliffhangers, losing by a single point to Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen in the Briton's 2007 debut season with McLaren.
He took his first title in 2008 with a pass on the last corner of the last lap of the final race.
In total 14 championships since 1950 have been won at the penultimate round, most recently Jenson Button with Brawn GP in 2009, and 29 at the last race.
Five titles in a row were decided in the penultimate race from 1987-91.","['425_0', '425_1']","[""\n      Formula One F1- Saudi Arabian Grand Prix - Jeddah Corniche Circuit, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia - December 2, 2021 Red Bull's Max Verstappen during the press conference Hassan Ammar/Pool via REUTERS\n    "", ""\n      Formula One F1- Saudi Arabian Grand Prix - Jeddah Corniche Circuit, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia - December 2, 2021 Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton during the press conference Hassan Ammar/Pool via REUTERS\n    ""]"

Verstappen leads Mercedes rival Lewis Hamilton by eight points in the standings heading into the season's penultimate race around the Red Sea city of Jeddah.
The 24-year-old Dutchman, who burst onto the scene as a 17-year-old prodigy in 2015, needs to finish at least second and for other results to go his way to clinch his long-awaited maiden title with a race to spare.
But you wouldn't know it.
""Like I’ve done the whole season,"" Verstappen told reporters in deadpan style when asked how he was approaching the Saudi Arabian race.
""I’ve always been very neutral, not read positive, negative things or in general not read too many things and be busy with other things in life. ""I think that helps a lot,"" he added.
Hamilton, gunning for a hat-trick of victories with the momentum having swung his way after resounding wins in Qatar and Brazil, looked similarly relaxed.
The 36-year-old seven-times world champion has experienced five down-to-the-wire title battles but is also exploring uncharted territory in his search for an unprecedented eighth world crown, which he acknowledged would count as his most meaningful.
""It’s different in one sense because we’ve got two incredibly close teams, it’s different because we’re fighting for uncharted territory, no one’s ever won eight titles, team or driver, so that’s quite fresh and new,"" said Hamilton, who will leave Saudi Arabia level on points with Verstappen to set up a winner takes all Abu Dhabi finale if he wins with the fastest lap ahead of the Dutchman.
""Then on the other side I’m more relaxed than I’ve ever been. I remember how it was my first championship and even my second and third, the sleepless nights and all those sorts of things.
""Obviously, (I'm) a lot more sure about myself and just applied myself better than ever before.

HARD-FOUGHT BATTLE
The Saudi Arabian Grand Prix is the first of only two races left on this year's Formula One calendar, with the hard-fought battle of the generations between Hamilton and Verstappen racing towards its conclusion.
Verstappen has his first shot at wrapping up a maiden title with a race to spare this weekend. Hamilton, his sights set on an unprecedented eighth world title, can keep the battle alive into Abu Dhabi so long as he finishes at least fifth.
The pair were separated by 0.056 seconds in the first session, with Verstappen wasting no time attacking and exploring the limits of the track.
But the Dutchman struggled to get heat into his soft tyres in the floodlit second hour of practice.
""There are of course a lot of things to work on and improve,"" he said. ""So we’ll see what we can do to get more pace out of the car overnight.
Mercedes could also wrap up a record eighth constructors' title on Sunday if they score 40 points more than Red Bull.
NEAR MISSES
Friday's action around the Jeddah street track, its flat-out blasts hemmed in by walls, was not without incident.
Leclerc lost control of his Ferrari at high speed on the approach to the fast Turn 22-23 chicane, crashing backwards into the barriers. The Monegasque, winded, walked away but the crash halted the session five minutes early.
Several drivers, including Hamilton, also got away with near misses as they were nearly caught out by slower moving cars while on their flying laps.

The Briton, who trails Red Bull's Max Verstappen by eight points in the overall standings with two races to go and this weekend is gunning for a third straight win, took avoiding action twice to avoid slower moving cars while on fast laps.
""That's definitely a lot worse than a lot of places we’ve been to,"" Hamilton, fastest in Friday's two sessions, added.
""Monaco-esque - the closing speed on other cars is definitely getting to a bit of a danger zone,"" he said referring to the narrow, twisting, albeit it slower, Monaco street track infamous for slower cars getting in the way of faster runners.
The new 6.1-km long Jeddah track is set to be the second quickest on the calendar after Italian 'Temple of Speed' Monza.
Its fast, flowing layout of mainly flat-out blasts along the city's Red Sea waterfront and a succession of high speed corners hemmed in by walls make it difficult for drivers to see slower moving cars, which could prove tricky during qualifying.
Charles Leclerc was caught out by the high-speed track, his Ferrari crashing backwards into the barriers during the second practice session, although the Monegasque, who was unhurt, was running by himself at the time.
""There’s so many kind of blind corners and closing speeds are high,"" said McLaren's Daniel Ricciardo. You try and get out of everyone’s way. I probably got in some people’s way today, some people got in mine.
""It can get very tricky, very messy, very quickly,"" added Red Bull's Sergio Perez.
Despite the risks, drivers enjoyed tearing around the coastal venue, their cars sparking away and looking spectacular under the floodlights.
""Rapid! It really is incredibly fast and a lot of grip as well,"" said seven-times world champion Hamilton.
""When you get the rhythm it’s a beautiful track.""
His Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas added: ""It’s quite hardcore, it’s pretty full gas and close to the walls and high speeds ... definitely gives you a bit of an adrenaline rush.""

The Briton also drew scrutiny for impeding AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly and Haas driver Nikita Mazepin, who had to take evasive action at high speed in a particularly heart-stopping moment.
Race director Michael Masi said he would talk to Mercedes directly about the incident, noting there were no flags warning the Briton of the speedily approaching Russian.
Hamilton on Friday had said the difference in closing speeds between slower cars and those on a flying lap around the blind high-speed sweeps of the Jeddah track were approaching a ""danger zone"".
The Saudi Arabian Grand Prix is the penultimate race on this year's Formula One calendar, with the hard-fought battle of the generations between Hamilton and Verstappen racing towards its conclusion.

Hamilton, eight points behind the Dutchman with two races to go, was joined on the front row by Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas after the floodlit session on the super-fast Jeddah Corniche street circuit.
Verstappen must finish at least second in the night race to have a chance of taking the title on Sunday.
While the 24-year-old qualified third, there were immediate concerns about the state of his car's gearbox and the possibility of a five-place grid penalty which would be triggered by any change.
""That was looking like the lap of the year,"" said Red Bull boss Christian Horner of Verstappen's last-gasp effort until the moment of impact.
""It was a mighty, mighty lap. He was pulling something very special out of the bag.""
Verstappen, who had been trying to beat Hamilton's time of one minute 27.511 seconds and had earlier brushed the wall at turn one without consequences, said it was a ""terrible"" end to the session.
His car slid wide after he braked late for turn 27, went across the track and his right rear hit the barrier. He had been some two-tenths of a second inside Hamilton's time through the first two sectors.
""I knew the pace was there and it showed at the end. I don't really understand what happened but I locked up. I still tried to keep the car on track and keep going but clipped the rear and had to stop,"" he said.
Seven-times world champion Hamilton, chasing a hat-trick of wins after victories in Brazil and Qatar that narrowed the gap to his 24-year-old rival, was delighted to be leading a front-row lockout.
""For us to get a one-two, I'm really proud of Valtteri and the men and women in our team who have just been working so hard. This is a great result,"" said the Briton after the latest twist in a roller-coaster season of fluctuating fortunes.
The pole was the 103rd of Hamilton's stellar career and fifth of the season and set him up for a record-extending 103rd win.
Mercedes are five points clear of Red Bull in the constructors' standings.
Ferrari's Charles Leclerc qualified fourth with Verstappen's team mate Sergio Perez lining up fifth and AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly sixth.
Frenchman Gasly was later given an official warning for impeding Ferrari's Carlos Sainz.  
McLaren's Lando Norris was seventh fastest with AlphaTauri's Yuki Tsunoda eighth, Alpine's Esteban Ocon ninth and Antonio Giovinazzi completing the top 10 for Alfa Romeo.
Hamilton started the session with the stewards still considering possible action against him after the champion was summoned for allegedly failing to respect warning flags and impeding Haas driver Nikita Mazepin in final practice.
In the end he was given a reprimand and Mercedes were fined 25,000 euros (US$28,282.50).
Sainz qualified only 15th after damaging his car's rear wing end-plate in a spin and brush with the wall that he managed to save from becoming something more serious.
With no time to fix the damage, the Spaniard tried again to reach the top 10 but complained over the radio that the car was 'undriveable'.

418,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/qualifying-crash-dents-hopes-early-title-party-verstappen-2359031,Qualifying crash dents hopes of early title party for Verstappen,"    Max Verstappen was left disappointed on Saturday after a last-gasp mistake in the dying seconds of qualifying for the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix cost him pole and dealt a blow to his chances of wrapping up a maiden Formula One title with a race to spare.
The Dutchman had produced a stunning display under the  floodlights, dancing his Red Bull right up against the walls lining the 6.1-km long Jeddah street track's high-speed sweeps.
He was comfortably on course to seize the fastest lap from title rival and provisional pole-sitter Lewis Hamilton until he pushed a touch too far, clouting the wall on the exit of the final corner after locking up on the way in, and was forced to settle for third place.
The contact broke Verstappen's rear suspension and may have damaged his gearbox, which could cost him five places on the grid if it needs to be changed.
It also allowed Mercedes to lock out the front row, with Valtteri Bottas second alongside Hamilton.
""I was really enjoying it and then not to finish it is extremely disappointing, especially now, in this fight, you want to start first,"" said Verstappen, who was 0.244 seconds ahead of Hamilton's time when he crashed and instead ended up 0.142 seconds adrift of the Briton.
""I saw it was a good lap, I was three-tenths faster on my delta. I thought last corner there might be still a bit to gain.
""I approached it like I always do in qualifying but now somehow I just locked up and I have to see if I actually braked later or not, for my feeling is I didn’t.""
Verstappen leads Hamilton by eight points in the overall standings and can clinch the title on Sunday if he finishes in the top two with other permutations working in his favour.
But a third-place finish, with Hamilton first and scoring the extra point for fastest lap, would see the Briton draw level on points, setting up a winner-takes-all last-race duel in Abu Dhabi.
Verstappen is confident Red Bull have the pace to challenge Mercedes on Sunday and will be going for the win rather than damage limitation.
""Of course I would have liked to start first,"" he said. ""Starting third is a bit more difficult but definitely not impossible.""

Both drivers were conscious and were extricated from their cars by medical crews, governing body the FIA said in a statement.
""The drivers were immediately attended to by emergency and medical crews. Both have been transferred by ambulance and helicopter to King Fahad Armed Forces Hospital, Jeddah,"" added the statement.
The crash between Frenchman Pourchaire, who races for ART, and Fittipaldi, who is the grandson of Brazilian Formula One double world champion Emerson Fittipaldi and races for the Charouz team, brought out the red flags on the first lap.
The race got underway with a rolling restart but was suspended shortly afterwards, following a brief safety car period, due to another accident involving Briton Olli Caldwell and Brazilian Guilherme Samaia. Both drivers walked away unhurt.
Formula Two was being run as a support event to the inaugural Saudi Arabian Formula One Grand Prix this weekend at the Jeddah Corniche street track.
Its 6.1-km layout , the second fastest on the calendar after Italian 'Temple of Speed' Monza, is made up of mainly flat-out blasts and blind sweeps hemmed in by walls and has raised safety concerns.

The red flags came out on lap 15 after a five-lap safety car period triggered by Mick Schumacher crashing his Haas into the barriers on Jeddah's super-fast and unforgiving Corniche street circuit.
That first stoppage appeared to play into the hands of Verstappen, who had stayed out while seven-times champion Hamilton pitted for fresh tyres from first after starting on pole position.
""Why is it a red flag?"" Hamilton asked over the team radio. ""The tyre wall looks fine... It's unbelievable, man.""
With cars returning to the pits, Verstappen's Red Bull team were able to change his tyres without the need for a further stop during the race.
That advantage disappeared, however, when the re-run standing start also brought out more red flags and Verstappen fell foul of the stewards.
Hamilton made the better getaway but Verstappen went off track to keep the lead, with Alpine's Esteban Ocon forcing his way past Hamilton into second place.
""I had to avoid a collision there,"" exclaimed Hamilton. ""He cut across the whole kerb. He just overtook me outside the white line.""
The race was halted when Haas's Russian rookie Nikita Mazepin and Williams' George Russell collided at the start while Verstappen's team mate Sergio Perez spun and was hit by Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.
Debris was strewn across the track, bordered by concrete walls and little in the way of runoff.
In an extraordinary sequence of radio exchanges, race director Michael Masi then offered Red Bull the ""opportunity"" to line up on the grid for the third standing start behind Hamilton, with Ocon in the lead.
""You'd be back behind Lewis,"" said the Australian. ""That is my offer.""
""We accept that,"" came the reply from Red Bull's team manager Jonathan Wheatley.
Verstappen then seized the lead.
The Dutch driver leads Hamilton by eight points with only one race remaining after Sunday. The youngster will be champion if he scores 18 points more than the Briton.

On a chaotic night in Jeddah, the first race in the Gulf kingdom took almost as many twists and turns as an already astonishing and enthralling rollercoaster season - and also left a bitter aftertaste.
There were crashes and collisions, safety cars, red flags, and claims of dirty driving after seven-times world champion Hamilton hit the back of Verstappen's suddenly slowing car on the super-fast Corniche street circuit.
Extraordinary, at times angry, radio exchanges between the race director Michael Masi and the top two teams filled the airwaves.
With a bonus point for fastest lap, Hamilton moved alongside Verstappen at the top of the standings with 369.5 points after 21 races.
Verstappen, who finished second with Valtteri Bottas third for Mercedes, leads 9-8 on wins, however - meaning that the Dutch 24-year-old will be champion if neither he nor Hamilton scores another point.
Mercedes extended their lead in the constructors' championship to 28 points and a record eighth successive title looking likely.
The final race is in Abu Dhabi next weekend.
Hamilton had started on pole but twice lost out to Verstappen, who began the day eight points ahead, at the standing re-starts.
The Dutch driver was ordered to hand back the lead, for going wide as Hamilton tried to pass on lap 37, but when he slowed Hamilton ran into the back of him.
""He just brake-tested me. I’ve just hit him, man, my wing’s broken,"" exclaimed the Briton. ""That was dangerous driving dude.""
Stewards summoned both drivers after the race and found Verstappen predominantly to blame, handing him a 10 second penalty that changed nothing.
The Dutchman did hand back the lead on lap 42 but took it back immediately.
Stewards then gave him a five-second time penalty for leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage but Verstappen again let Hamilton through.
""We didn’t need to do that, Max,"" said his race engineer.
Mercedes told Masi they had not been given sufficient time to inform Hamilton that Verstappen would give back the place, and the Red Bull driver was also furious.
""What happened today is unbelievable and this sport is more about penalties than racing. For me, this is not Formula One,"" he fumed after being told he had been voted 'Driver of the Day'.
The red flags first came out on lap 14 after a safety car period triggered by Mick Schumacher crashing his Haas.
That played into the hands of Verstappen, who stayed out while Hamilton pitted from the lead for fresh tyres to take advantage of the safety car deployment.
The advantage disappeared, however, when the standing re-start triggered more chaos.
Hamilton made the better getaway but Verstappen went off track to keep the lead, with Alpine's Esteban Ocon - who finished fourth after being pipped by Bottas at the end - forcing his way into second place.
""I had to avoid a collision there,"" exclaimed Hamilton. ""He (Verstappen) cut across the whole kerb. He just overtook me outside the white line.""
The race was halted a lap later when Haas's Russian rookie Nikita Mazepin and Williams's George Russell collided while Verstappen's team-mate Sergio Perez was tagged by Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and spun.
Masi offered Red Bull the ""opportunity"" to line up on the grid for the third standing start behind Hamilton, with Ocon in the lead.
""You'd be back behind Lewis,"" said the Australian. ""That is my offer.""
""We accept that,"" came the reply from Red Bull's team manager Jonathan Wheatley.
Verstappen seized the lead again, with Hamilton passing Ocon, and the battle was on - punctuated by more virtual safety car periods.
""Get in there Lewis!"" Hamilton's race engineer shouted at the chequered flag. ""That has got to be the craziest race I can remember, the cool heads won that out.""
Australian Daniel Ricciardo finished fifth for McLaren, ahead of AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly and Leclerc. Ferrari's Carlos Sainz was eighth, with Antonio Giovinazzi ninth for Alfa Romeo and Lando Norris 10th for McLaren.","['415_0', '415_1', '415_2', '415_3', '415_4']","[""\n      Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton celebrates with the trophy on the podium after winning the race as second-placed Red Bull's Max Verstappen looks dejected.

414,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/motor-racing-timeline-events-saudi-arabian-gp-2360221,Motor racing - Timeline of events in the Saudi Arabian GP,"    The inaugural Saudi Arabian Grand Prix served up a thrilling battle between Formula One championship leader Max Verstappen and Mercedes title rival Lewis Hamilton on Sunday. Here is how the race, which saw two red-flag stoppages, panned out: 
Race Start - Hamilton keeps the lead ahead of Valtteri Bottas in a Mercedes one-two, Verstappen slots into third.
Lap 10 - Mick Schumacher crashes heavily in his Haas at Turn 23, safety car deployed. Hamilton and Bottas are among the drivers to pit under the safety car. Verstappen stays out, and inherits the race lead.
L14 - Red flag is thrown out to halt the race so repairs can be carried out to the Turn 23 barriers. This plays into Verstappen’s hands as the rules allow a driver to change tyres under a red flag.
""Why is there a red flag? The tyre wall looks fine! Find out what the reason is,"" Hamilton says to his team on the radio.
""It is a risk we knew we had because we knew they could throw the red flag, I'll come talk to you,"" responds Mercedes strategist James Vowles.  
L15 - Race restarts after an 18-minute stoppage. The cars line up on the grid for a standing start, Verstappen at the front, Hamilton alongside in second. 
    Hamilton gets a better start and jumps into the lead off the line, Verstappen cuts the corner and takes back the lead. Verstappen’s move leaves Hamilton wrong-footed, Alpine’s Esteban Ocon passes him and pushes him down to third.
Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc tags Sergio Perez and sends the Red Bull into a spin. The Mexican is out on the spot. As cars slow down to avoid him, Haas driver Nikita Mazepin crashes into the back of George Russell’s Williams.
Race halted again.
L16 - Race restarts again. Race director Michael Masi orders Verstappen to line up behind Hamilton, effectively giving back the place he gained from the Briton by going off track at the previous restart.
As a result, Ocon lines up first, Hamilton second, Verstappen third.
Hamilton gets a good start but Verstappen passes him on the inside into the first corner. The Dutchman passes Ocon for the lead on the following straight. Hamilton makes light contact with Ocon going into the first corner and escapes unscathed.
Hamilton passes Ocon at the end of the lap. He moves up to second and sets about chasing Verstappen as the two begin trading fastest laps.
L23 - Virtual Safety Car deployed. Yuki Tsunoda crashes into the barriers, breaking his front wing. He is able to get back to the pits under his own power.
L24 - Virtual Safety Car Ends.
L28 - Virtual Safety Car deployed again briefly.
L29 - Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen collide, leaving debris on the track. Virtual Safety Car deployed for the third time.   
L33 - Virtual Safety Car ends. Verstappen is 1.6 seconds clear of Hamilton.
L36 - Virtual Safety Car deployed again.
L37 - Hamilton gets a nice exit out of the last corner and, with the DRS open, gets a good run on the Red Bull. He pulls up alongside and attempts to pass him on the outside. Both run wide. Verstappen is asked to give the position to Hamilton.
Verstappen slows down ahead of Hamilton. Hamilton, appearing not to have got the message, runs into the Red Bull and damages his own front wing.  
L38 - Hamilton radio: “He just brake-tested me! I’ve just hit him, man, my wing’s broken.
Race engineer responds: It looks okay, he’s been told to give you the position.
Hamilton: “That was dangerous driving dude.”
Mercedes sporting director Ron Meadows radios race director Masi saying Mercedes did not know Verstappen was going to let Hamilton past at that part of the track. Masi says he has informed him already that Verstappen is going to give the place back. Meadows responds that he was still in the process of telling Hamilton's race engineer to pass the message on to the Briton. 
L42 - Verstappen gives Hamilton the lead but takes it back immediately.
L43 - Stewards give Verstappen a five-second time penalty for leaving the track and gaining an advantage.
Verstappen lets Hamilton through into the lead. “We didn’t need to do that, Max,” his engineer tells him as Verstappen has already been given a time penalty.
Stewards say they will investigate the collision between Hamilton and Verstappen after the race. 
L46 - “Just be careful on the kerbs,” Hamilton, setting fastest laps despite nursing a damaged front wing, is told over the radio. Masi also tells Mercedes to warn Hamilton that his swerve toward Verstappen while going past was ""borderline.""
L50 - Hamilton wins, Bottas snatches third from Ocon at the very end, out-dragging him across the line with his DRS overtaking aid wide open. ""Get in there Lewis!"" Hamilton's race engineer says on the radio. ""That has got to be the craziest race I can remember, the cool heads won that out.""
""It is what it is, mate, I tried at least,"" Verstappen says on the radio.
""I don't know why he went into the back of you like that,"" Red Bull team boss Christian Horner responds.
Race finish - Hamilton wins and scores fastest lap. He now heads into the Abu Dhabi finale next weekend level on points with Verstappen. Verstappen leads as he as won more races. Verstappen is also voted driver of the day by fans.

Hamilton exclaimed over the team radio that the Red Bull driver had 'brake-tested' him after he ran into the back of Verstappen's car and damaged his front wing.
Race stewards summoned both drivers after the race and found Verstappen ""predominantly at fault"" for the collision. He was given a time penalty of 10 seconds, with no change to the result, and two penalty points. 
Hamilton went on to win, and take the fastest lap, for Mercedes, with Verstappen second in a chaotic race with emotions running high and everything at stake.
The pair are now tied at the top on points with one race in Abu Dhabi remaining.
""I've raced a lot of drivers through my life. In the 28 years I've come across a lot of different characters,"" Hamilton told Sky Sports television.
""There's a few at the top which are... kind of, yeah, over the limit. Rules kind of don't apply, or don't think of the rules,"" added the Briton.
Hamilton said Verstappen, who leads Hamilton on race wins 9-8 and will be champion if neither scores another point, was one of those who fell into the category.
""He's over the limit, for sure,"" he said of a youngster who has earned plenty of admirers for his speed and talent while acquiring a reputation for aggressive and uncompromising racing.
""I've avoided collision on so many occasions with the guy and I don't always mind being the one that does that, because you live to fight another day. Which I obviously did.""
Hamilton said he was not informed that his rival had been told to give the lead back after he went off and gained an advantage while defending against Hamilton in an earlier wheel-to-wheel clash.
""I didn't get the information so I didn't really understand what was going on,"" said the champion. ""It was very, very confusing. All of a sudden he started backing up and then kind of moving a little bit.
""I was like 'Is he trying to play some kind of crazy tactic?'
""Then all of a sudden the message started coming through just as he hit the brakes so hard and I nearly... took us both out,"" he added. ""It doesn't matter for him if we both don't finish. For me we both need to finish.""
Verstappen said he had been downshifting and braking for Hamilton to go past.
""I was just looking in the mirror and waiting for him to pass,"" he said. ""Maybe there was some confusion going on... they told me on the radio 'let him by' so that is immediately what I did.""

412,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/verstappen-predominantly-fault-hamilton-collision-officials-say-2360356,"Verstappen predominantly at fault in Hamilton collision, officials say","    Max Verstappen defended his driving after Formula One stewards found him predominantly responsible for a collision with title rival Lewis Hamilton in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix on Sunday.
The 24-year-old Red Bull driver was handed two time penalties totalling 15 seconds - a five-second sanction awarded during the race for running off the track and keeping the lead while defending against Hamilton and a 10-second penalty after the race for a collision as he attempted to hand the place back.
""I went to drive to the right side and I slowed down and I was braking, downshifting and he just stayed super close behind me,"" Verstappen said, adding he was just trying to let Hamilton pass.
Hamilton, who ran into the back of the Red Bull car, later accused his rival of ""brake-testing"".
""I’m just going slower and slower, pulling the downshift and then we had a miscommunication or whatever and he ran into the back of me and yeah that was it,"" Verstappen said.
In their verdict, the stewards acknowledged that Hamilton could have driven past when he saw Verstappen slowing.
But they understood why neither he nor Verstappen wanted to be in front heading into the DRS zone, which would have made whoever was in front vulnerable to impact from behind.
They found Verstappen braked suddenly and erratically and determined he had been predominantly at fault.
Speaking about his lap 37 defensive move, Verstappen said he didn't understand why he had been singled out for the five-second penalty.
""I find it interesting that I am the one that gets the penalty when both of us run outside of the white lines,"" he said.
""You could clearly see both didn’t make the corner.
""I think lately we’re talking more about white lines and penalties than actually proper Formula One racing.""
Verstappen keeps his second place behind winner Hamilton despite the stewards' sanctions.
The 36-year-old Briton's win, along with the extra point he scored for fastest lap, sees him draw level on points with his 24-year-old rival with only next week's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to go.
The Dutchman is in the overall lead, however, on account of having won more races, setting up an enticing winner-takes-all finale.

MERCEDES (Lewis Hamilton 1, Valtteri Bottas 3) 
Hamilton started on pole initially and took the 103rd win of his career, third in a row and eighth of the season to level on points with Verstappen, who still leads on race wins. He also set the fastest lap. Bottas, in his 100th race for Mercedes, took third from Ocon by 30 metres in a dash for the line. Mercedes are now 28 points ahead of Red Bull in the constructors' championship.
RED BULL (Max Verstappen 2, Sergio Perez retired) 
Verstappen was third initially but stayed out when the safety car was deployed and Hamilton and Bottas pitted. Red flags gave him a free pitstop. He led from the re-start but the race was stopped again and he had to line up behind Hamilton and Ocon as a penalty for gaining an advantage by going off. He then had to hand the lead to Hamilton on lap 38 for another aggressive defence and the pair collided. Perez crashed at the first re-start after contact with Leclerc.
FERRARI (Charles Leclerc 7, Carlos Sainz 8)
Leclerc pitted when the safety car was first deployed, an advantage that disappeared with the red flags. He made contact with Perez at the first re-start but was able to continue.  Sainz went from 15th to eighth. Ferrari's advantage over McLaren was trimmed to 38.5 points, but third place looks secure. 
MCLAREN (Daniel Ricciardo 5, Lando Norris 10)
Ricciardo made up places at the starts, rising from 11th to fourth before a late battle with Bottas. The first red flag cost Norris positions.
ALPINE (Esteban Ocon 4, Fernando Alonso 13)
Ocon was first at the final re-start and went three-abreast with Hamilton and Verstappen, losing out to both. He came within touching distance of the podium but was beaten by Bottas on the final straight. Alonso said his race was effectively over at the first red flag, having already pitted.
ALPHATAURI (Pierre Gasly 6, Yuki Tsunoda 14)
Tsunoda collided with Vettel at turn one while in ninth place, losing his front wing. He was given a five-second time penalty, with the virtual safety car deployed due to the debris on track. Gasly started sixth but was eighth after lap one.
ASTON MARTIN (Lance Stroll 11, Sebastian Vettel retired) 
Stroll lost out to Norris after climbing to 10th. Vettel suffered significant floor damage in the collision with Tsunoda, which sent him into a spin, and then had another clash with Raikkonen which caused further damage.
WILLIAMS (Nicholas Latifi 12, George Russell retired)
Russell retired after a lap 15 collision with Mazepin at the first re-start, which led to more red flags. Williams are 10 points clear of Alfa Romeo.
ALFA ROMEO (Antonio Giovinazzi 9, Kimi Raikkonen 15)
Giovinazzi scored in his penultimate race for the team, running seventh for much of the race before losing out to the Ferrari drivers. Raikkonen's race was wrecked by the contact with Vettel.
HAAS (Nikita Mazepin and Mick Schumacher retired)
Schumacher crashed into the barrier on lap 10, bringing out the safety car and then red flags. Mazepin crashed out at
the re-start.

The two rivals are now level on points after Sunday's chaotic race in Saudi Arabia but Red Bull's Verstappen is ahead of Mercedes' seven-time world champion 9-8 on race wins.
Britain's 1996 world champion Damon Hill is wary of history repeating itself, and suggested that the sport's governing body should send a clear warning.
""There is a precedent that was set in the championship in 1997 where (Michael) Schumacher's points were taken away from him,"" he told Sky Sports television viewers in his role as a pundit.
""So if we do have a (collision) situation, I think the FIA should make the teams and drivers know in advance what they are likely to do. Will they take points away? What's the penalty?""
Ferrari's seven-time world champion Schumacher and Williams' Jacques Villeneuve went into the final race of 1997 at Jerez in Spain with the German leading the Canadian by a single point.
The pair collided while battling for the lead, with Schumacher forced to retire and later stripped of all his points for the season for what was seen to be an attempt to take out his title rival. Villeneuve finished third and was champion.
In 1994, Hill and Schumacher battled for the crown at the final race in Adelaide, with the Briton also a point behind the German.
Schumacher hit the wall and then collided with Hill as the Williams tried to overtake, with both drivers retiring and the German taking his first title. Stewards declared it a racing incident.
Hill did not suggest that Verstappen would resort to dirty tricks, but saw similarities with Schumacher in his aggressive and take-no-prisoners driving style.
""There are some people who drive with absolutely no compromises whatsoever. And I think Max is one of those people,"" he said.
""He's very skilful and he's brilliant and it's exciting to watch. I think Lewis, who has to deal with that, is now very cautious - he's not intimidated, but he's very wary of Max and probably rightly so.""",['410_0'],"[""\nRed Bull's Max Verstappen crosses the line to finish the Formula 1 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix in second place on Dec 5, 2021.

""I'd like to compliment the FIA and... Masi in handling well what was an extremely difficult race,"" Brawn wrote in a column for the F1 website on Tuesday.
""I know some people feel some of the decisions were controversial but I don't... I think Michael dealt with it pragmatically.""
In Jeddah, a twice-halted race won by Hamilton, Masi offered Red Bull the opportunity to drop Verstappen from first to third on the grid at the re-start and avoid being referred to the stewards with the risk of a penalty.
The exchange was messy, with initial confusion about where Verstappen would line up.
Red Bull team boss Christian Horner told reporters afterwards that it was unusual and sounded ""a bit like being down the souk (local market).""
Brawn said it was a quick and simple solution to a situation.
""Some people seem to think Michael was doing a deal. He wasn't doing a deal,"" he said. 
""It was simple: you accept the decision of the race director, with a known outcome, or it gets passed to the stewards to handle it.""
Verstappen was handed two separate time penalties in Jeddah for track misdemeanours and Horner said later the sport was missing Charlie Whiting, Masi's universally-respected predecessor who died before the 2019 season.
Mercedes boss Toto Wolff has also clashed with Masi, speaking of 'laughable' decisions at last month's Sao Paulo Grand Prix when stewards took no action against Verstappen for a move that forced Hamilton off.
Masi has said every competitor is treated equally and fairly, but recognised those penalised would take a different view.
The Australian has become more prominent this season since the sport began broadcasting radio communications between the teams and race director, adding to the sense of theatre but also bringing more public scrutiny.
With so much at stake and the possibility of a collision, controversial move or penalty deciding the outcome in Abu Dhabi, Masi and the stewards are enforcers of rules and defenders of fair play.
Sunday's race at Yas Marina will be only the second time in Formula One history that two drivers have gone into a decider level on points.
The first was at the 1974 U.S. Grand Prix when Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi beat Swiss driver Clay Regazzoni.

DUBLIN :Insulation firm Kingspan and the Mercedes Formula One team have agreed to end a sponsorship deal, they said on Wednesday, amid a backlash about the Irish company's link to Britain's 2017 Grenfell Tower fire.
British Housing Minister Michael Gove and survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire last week called for Lewis Hamilton's team to reconsider a sponsorship deal due to Kingspan's link to the 2017 London disaster.
The Grenfell fire killed 72 people, with combustible cladding used on the residential block identified as central to the rapid spread of flames.
Kingspan, whose branding features on the team's cars, said that while its UK insulation business was a core participant in the Grenfell Tower Inquiry, it did not supply or manufacture the panels identified as the main reason why the flames spread so rapidly and had no role in the refurbishment.
Kingspan has said its K15 product constituted approximately 5per cent of the insulation in the building and that it ""was used as a substitute product without Kingspan's knowledge in a system that was not compliant with the buildings regulations.""
""We are deeply aware of the sensitivities raised in recent days, and so we have jointly agreed that it's not appropriate to move forward at the current point in time,"" it said in a statement.
Mercedes, which did not mention Grenfell, said in a Twitter post https://twitter.com/MercedesAMGF1/status/1468536086528159747 that both sides had ""concluded that it was not appropriate for the partnership to move forward.""
Mercedes boss Toto Wolff had said last week that he would meet survivors of the fire after apologising on behalf of his team for any distress caused by the sponsorship deal.

406,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/six-standout-moments-2021-f1-title-battle-2367426,Six standout moments in the 2021 F1 title battle,"    Red Bull's Max Verstappen and Mercedes's Lewis Hamilton head into the final race of the 2021 Formula One season in Abu Dhabi on Sunday tied on points, but Verstappen ahead on wins.
Here are six standout moments from the championship:
BLOWN TYRE AND BRAKE MAGIC
Azerbaijan Grand Prix - Baku, June 6.
Verstappen, four points clear in the championship, was leading Mexican team mate Sergio Perez in a Red Bull one-two when a tyre blew on the main straight with five laps to go.
The race was halted with Hamilton set to cash in on his rival's misfortune. Perez led away at the re-start with Hamilton second but accidentally engaging a 'brake magic' switch which sent him down an escape road. He finished 15th while Perez won.
RECRIMINATIONS AFTER TITLE RIVALS COLLIDE
British Grand Prix - Silverstone, July 18
Verstappen went 33 points clear after winning the first ever Saturday sprint, with Hamilton second. The pair then collided on Sunday's opening lap.
Verstappen went to hospital for precautionary checks while Hamilton collected a 10-second penalty for causing the collision but still won his home grand prix and slashed the lead to eight points.
The moment the gloves came off and relations between the two teams nosedived.
BOTTAS WRECKS VERSTAPPEN'S RACE
Hungarian Grand Prix - Budapest, Aug. 1
Hamilton charged through from last to third to retake the overall lead from Verstappen, who finished 10th from second on the grid.
Hamilton's team mate Valtteri Bottas wrecked Verstappen's race when he made a slow start and tagged McLaren's Lando Norris, who was in turn pitched into the Red Bull, bringing out red flags.
Hamilton led at the re-start but on the wrong tyres and had to pit a lap later, rejoining at the back.
VERSTAPPEN ON TOP OF HAMILTON'S CAR
Italian Grand Prix - Monza, Sept. 12
Another sprint weekend, another collision between the two title rivals. Hamilton started fourth while Verstappen inherited pole after engine penalties sent sprint winner Bottas to the back.
Hamilton challenged Verstappen but was forced onto the run-off area at the second chicane. When Hamilton pitted, he came out alongside his rival on lap 26 and they went wheel to wheel before contact into the first chicane.
Verstappen's Red Bull ended up on top of Hamilton's Mercedes and both were out.
STEWARDS TAKE NO ACTION, HAMILTON LAST TO FIRST
Brazilian Grand Prix - Sao Paulo, Nov. 14
Hamilton needed to win after Verstappen's wins in the U.S. and Mexico. The Briton led qualifying for Saturday's sprint but was sent to the back when his car's rear wing failed a technical inspection.
He fought back to fifth but an engine penalty dropped him to 10th for Sunday, a race he then won.
A key moment came when Verstappen forced Hamilton off and also went wide while defending the lead. Stewards took no action, a decision that set a precedent and produced incredulity at Mercedes.
VERSTAPPEN'S 'BRAKE-TEST' MOMENT
Saudi Arabian Grand Prix - Jeddah, Dec. 5
Verstappen had his first title shot, while Hamilton chased a third win in a row. The Dutch driver was set for pole when he hit the wall at the final corner.
The race was twice stopped before the pair collided on lap 37 when Verstappen slowed suddenly in front of Hamilton after being told to hand back the lead.
Hamilton complained of being 'brake-tested' but then won with fastest lap to tie at the top.

405,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/f1-tenterhooks-history-hamilton-or-victory-verstappen-2367451,F1 on tenterhooks: History for Hamilton or victory for Verstappen,"Lewis Hamilton will become either the first Formula One driver to win eight world championships or be dethroned by young nemesis Max Verstappen under the Abu Dhabi floodlights on Sunday.
Either a record will be set, one surely destined to be longer lasting than Ferrari great Michael Schumacher's seven between 1994-2004, or Hamilton's long reign will end in a generational shift.
For the first time since 1974, and only the second since the world championship started in 1950 although scoring systems have changed, two title contenders go into the final round absolutely level on points.
Whatever the outcome, the showdown promises to be television ratings gold.
Verstappen has won nine races to Hamilton's eight - a key advantage that means the Briton must score while the Red Bull driver could even become champion during the race if his rival retires.
Otherwise, whoever finishes ahead of the other - unless Hamilton is ninth and Verstappen 10th with fastest lap - takes the title.
That has also raised fears that the outcome could be decided by a collision between the two, as has happened notoriously in the past in final showdowns where so much is at stake and one driver has everything to gain by taking out the other.
For all Verstappen's aggressive driving, his take-no-prisoners style, bad-tempered exchanges and high emotions, Red Bull and their Dutch youngster have been clear they want to win the title fair and square.
""He's a hard racer but a fair racer, and I expect no different this weekend,"" team boss Christian Horner told the Times newspaper.
""Nobody wants to win this championship in a gravel trap or in a stewards' inquiry.
""They've been hard races. They've gone wheel to wheel. But I think, for all the fans, you want to see a fair and clean fight in this last round and may the best team and best driver win.""
Although the wheel-to-wheel duel between the 36-year-old Hamilton and his 24-year-old challenger has an epochal tone to it, the Briton's Mercedes team can continue their era of domination with an eighth successive constructors' crown.
They are 28 points ahead and Horner has admitted it will take a miracle to stop them.
""It's all or nothing for the season finale and that's amazing for the sport, amazing for the fans and amazing for all of us, too,"" commented Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff.
Verstappen won in Abu Dhabi last year, leading every lap from pole position, but the circuit has been shortened and modified since then in the hope of creating more overtaking opportunities.
Hamilton had also already won his seventh title and was recovering from contracting COVID-19 that forced him to miss the previous race in Bahrain.
This time the reigning champion should have the benefit of a newer engine than Verstappen and is also riding high after three race wins in a row.
The race will be a farewell for Red Bull's engine partner Honda, although they will continue to assemble the power units next year before the energy drink company takes over the intellectual property.
Hamilton's team mate Valtteri Bottas will be racing for Mercedes for the last time before moving to Alfa Romeo, with George Russell replacing the Finn and saying goodbye to Williams.
The lower placings will also be settled, with Ferrari set to secure third.",['405_0'],"[""\nFILE PHOTO: Formula One F1 - United States Grand Prix - Circuit of the Americas, Austin, Texas, U.S. - October 24, 2021 Red Bull's Max Verstappen celebrates on the podium after winning the race with second place Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo\n""]"

403,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/formula-one-statistics-abu-dhabi-grand-prix-2367466,Formula One statistics for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix,"    Formula One statistics for Sunday's season-ending and title-deciding Abu Dhabi Grand Prix at Yas Marina:
Lap distance: 5.281km.
Total distance: 306.183km (58 laps)
2020 pole position: Max Verstappen (Netherlands) Red Bull - one minute 35.246 seconds.
2020 winner: Verstappen
Race lap record: Circuit has been modified since 2020.
Start time: 1300 GMT (1700 local)
ABU DHABI
The circuit runs anti-clockwise. Mercedes have won six of the last seven editions.
Five current drivers have won at Yas Marina: Sebastian Vettel (2009, 2010 and 2013), Lewis Hamilton (2011, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2019), Kimi Raikkonen (2012), Valtteri Bottas (2017), Verstappen (2020).
Hamilton has been on pole five times there.
Only once has the winner not started on the front row: Raikkonen from fourth in 2012 with Lotus.
RACE WINS
Hamilton has a record 103 career victories, of which 82 have been with Mercedes, from 287 starts. He has been on the podium 181 times.
Red Bull's championship leader Max Verstappen has won nine times this year to Hamilton's eight. Red Bull's Sergio Perez, Alpine's Esteban Ocon, McLaren's Daniel Ricciardo and Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas have each won once.
Ferrari have won 238 races since 1950, McLaren 183, Mercedes 124, Williams 114 and Red Bull 74.
POLE POSITION
Hamilton has a record 103 career poles and has won 61 times from pole. Team mate Bottas has had four poles in 2021.
Verstappen has been on pole nine times in 2021, while Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was fastest in Azerbaijan and Monaco qualifying. McLaren's Lando Norris was on pole in Russia.
CHAMPIONSHIP
Verstappen and Hamilton are level on 369.5 points after 21 races, with Verstappen ahead on wins. It is only the second time drivers have been tied at the top before the final race. The other was in 1974.
That means if Hamilton retires or fails to score, Verstappen is champion.
Otherwise, the champion is whoever finishes ahead of the other - unless Hamilton is ninth and Verstappen 10th but with fastest lap.
Mercedes lead Red Bull by 28 points in the constructors' standings and need 17 points to be assured of the title. Red Bull team boss Christian Horner said last weekend it would take a miracle to beat them.
Mercedes would be the first team to win eight successive constructors' championships. Ferrari won six in a row from 1999-2004. McLaren won four consecutively from 1988-91 and Red Bull four from 2010-13.
MILESTONES
Hamilton is already the most successful Formula One driver of all time but can become the first to win eight world championships.
Verstappen, 24, would be the first Dutch driver to take the title.
The Red Bull driver would also be the fourth youngest champion of all time - behind Vettel (23 and 134 days in 2010), Hamilton (23 and 301 days in 2008) and Fernando Alonso (24 and 59 days in 2005).
Verstappen has 17 podiums this season and one more would be a record for a driver in a single championship.
FAREWELLS
Sunday is a last race for Ferrari's 2007 world champion Raikkonen, now with Alfa Romeo.
It is also the last for Bottas at Mercedes before replacing Raikkonen, for George Russell at Williams before taking Bottas's place and for departing Antonio Giovinazzi at Alfa Romeo.
Honda, Red Bull's partners, are departing as an engine supplier.
It will also be the last race with the 13-inch tyres, with the sport switching to low-profile 18-inch ones for 2022 as part of new technical regulations.

USA 1959
BRABHAM PUSHES HIS CAR OVER THE LINE
Jack Brabham became Australia's first world champion in dramatic style, pushing his Cooper across the line at Sebring after running out of fuel. Three drivers were in contention: Stirling Moss and Tony Brooks both needed to win with fastest lap but Moss retired with a broken gearbox and Brooks was third. Brabham was fourth while Bruce McLaren won, the 22-year-old becoming the youngest winner of a championship race - a record now held by Verstappen who was 18 when he won in 2016.
USA 1974
FITTIPALDI TAKES MCLAREN'S FIRST TITLE
McLaren's Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi and Ferrari's Swiss racer Clay Regazzoni were level on points, with Tyrrell's South African Jody Scheckter seven behind but also still in with a chance providing he won. Scheckter qualified sixth, Fittipaldi eighth, Regazzoni ninth. The Swiss made the better start but Fittipaldi managed to pass him, two wheels on the grass, and finished fourth for his second title and McLaren's first.
JAPAN 1976
HUNT TRIUMPHS IN THE RAIN
Ferrari's Niki Lauda had come back from a near-fatal crash at the Nuerburgring to lead his flamboyant British rival James Hunt by three points going to the final race at Fuji. In atrocious weather, the Austrian retired after two laps of the race saying it was madness to continue while Hunt finished third for McLaren to take the title by a single point. The dramatic season-long rivalry was made into a 2013 movie, ""Rush"".
AUSTRALIA 1986
EXPLODING TYRE ENDS MANSELL'S HOPES
The Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide was between Nigel Mansell, leading on 70 points, Alain Prost (64) and Nelson Piquet (63). With only the 11 best results counting, Mansell needed only to finish third to be champion. The Williams driver was heading for the title when his left-rear tyre exploded at 270kph, the car bucking and sparking as he fought to control it down the straight on three wheels. Prost was champion.   
AUSTRALIA 1994
SCHUMACHER AND HILL COLLIDE
Michael Schumacher, then at Benetton, led Damon Hill by a point into the final race of a tragic season overshadowed by the death of Hill's Williams team mate Ayrton Senna. Schumacher led from the start, with Hill second, but hit the wall on lap 36. When Hill tried to go past, Schumacher turned in and they collided. Both retired, with stewards deciding it was a racing incident. The title was the first of the German's seven.
JEREZ 1997
SCHUMACHER AND VILLENEUVE COLLIDE 
The European Grand Prix in Jerez saw Schumacher, now at Ferrari, leading Canadian Jacques Villeneuve by a single point. They collided while battling for the lead, with Schumacher out and the Williams driver finishing third to win the title. Schumacher was later disqualified from the championship by the FIA who ruled he deliberately tried to take out his rival. 
BRAZIL 2008
THE LAST CORNER OF THE LAST LAP 
Hamilton, then at McLaren, celebrated his first title after a race won by Ferrari's Felipe Massa, who was champion until his British rival passed Toyota's Timo Glock for fifth on the last corner of the last lap at Interlagos to take the crown by a point. Glock subsequently received death threats.
ABU DHABI 2010 
VETTEL'S FIRST TITLE  
A record four drivers remained in with a chance at the last race, with Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel only third favourite and 15 points behind Ferrari's Fernando Alonso. Red Bull's Australian Mark Webber was second in the standings and Hamilton fourth, but Vettel started on pole and won to become the youngest ever world champion at 23.

Mercedes Lewis Hamilton, 36, and his 24-year-old Red Bull rival Max Verstappen head into the floodlit finale at the Yas Marina track level on points but Verstappen ahead 9-8 on wins, which would make him champion if both fail to score.
The pair have collided three times this season, including at the last race in Saudi Arabia, raising concerns about a thrilling season ending with a collision.
However, outlining the articles of the sport's International Sporting Code relating to ""unsportsmanlike"" conduct and the penalties for such behaviour, Masi sent a clear warning that such a scenario could result in severe consequences.
""In particular I would like to remind you of the following articles detailed below,"" the Australian said in his event notes on Thursday.
He singled out Article 12.2.1l which deals with ""any infringement of the principles of fairness in competition, behaviour in an unsportsmanlike manner or attempt to influence the result of a competition in a way that is contrary to sporting ethics.""
Masi also mentioned Article 12.4.5 which covers penalties stewards could impose including ""suspension for one or more competitions, withdrawal of points for the championship, cup, challenge, trophy, series.""
Verstappen, in particular, has drawn scrutiny for his uncompromising wheel-to-wheel racing.
Stewards took a dim view of his defensive tactics against Hamilton in Jeddah and found him predominantly at fault for triggering the collision, handing him two-time penalties totalling 15 seconds.
After the race in Jeddah, 1996 world champion Damon Hill told Sky Sports the governing FIA needed to warn Verstappen and Hamilton of the consequences should a collision between them decide the title.
""There is a precedent that was set in the championship in 1997 where (Michael) Schumacher's points were taken away from him,"" he said.
""So if we do have a (collision) situation, I think the FIA should make the teams and drivers know in advance what they are likely to do.""",['401_0'],"[""\nFILE PHOTO: Formula One F1 - United States Grand Prix - Circuit of the Americas, Austin, Texas, U.S. - October 24, 2021 Red Bull's Max Verstappen and Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton in action at the start of the race REUTERS/Mike Blake\n""]"

But if he beats 24-year-old Red Bull rival Max Verstappen at Yas Marina, Hamilton will break the last of the Ferrari great's major records.
""It wasn't unimaginable but I think it was seen as impossible,"" Hamilton, level on points with Verstappen after winning the last three races, told F1TV when he clinched his seventh title in 2020.
""However I still dreamt of it, I dream of going to space ... I believe in things and I think when you dream we all come up with these crazy ideas.""
Those dreams have driven the sport's only Black driver as he emerged from an underprivileged background far from racing to become one of the world's wealthiest and most prominent sportsmen.
The grandson of immigrants from the Caribbean island of Grenada, Hamilton - now a winner of 103 races - has stayed close to his roots and family.
His parents separated when he was two and father Anthony held down multiple jobs to fund his son's early karting activities until McLaren and Mercedes stepped in.
Hamilton's success and varied interests, ranging from making music to promoting young Black fashion designers and embracing veganism, have earned him a global crossover appeal unlike any other champion of the past.
Subjected to racism from his karting days, when he was the only Black kid on the grid, he has used his profile to campaign for racial equality, environmental issues and LGBTQ+ rights and against cruelty to animals.
""It’s obviously no secret that I’ve really walked this sport alone: the only Black person here, or the only person of colour here,"" Hamilton, who has set up a commission to boost participation by Black people in motorsport, said last year.
""When I was younger, I didn’t have anybody in the sport that looked like me.""
Hamilton, who has worn a rainbow-themed helmet in the final three races in the Middle East in solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community, said in October that his campaigning had given him fresh energy.
""This year I've not been drawing on past experiences, I've been drawing on feeding off this energy of doing this positive work,"" he said.
""Is it helping me race? I think so, yeah. It's like my new drive and I feel like it's giving me more longevity because it's a lot of work we have to do. I feel like it also gives my life real purpose.""
In Verstappen, another natural talent who has set records of his own as youngest F1 driver and race winner, he faces his toughest fight in years.
The Dutchman is unafraid to push the limit and occasionally cross it.
The pair have collided three times already, including in the last race in Jeddah, and Hamilton has had to bail out in wheel-to-wheel combat to avoid an accident.
If the pair crash out on Sunday, Verstappen, who leads the Briton 9-8 on wins, will win the title but Hamilton thrives under pressure.
""It’s definitely an incredibly intense year and time,"" said Hamilton, who made his debut with McLaren alongside double champion Fernando Alonso and beat the Spaniard to second in the standings.
""I’ve raced for 28 years, I’ve had so many intense battles through karting, through single-seaters, and this is one of them.""

399,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/verstappen-born-racer-ready-seize-his-chance-2369736,"Verstappen, a born racer ready to seize his chance","    Formula One title contender Max Verstappen was born to race, hailed as a future world champion even before he made history as a 17-year-old rookie in 2015.
The 24-year-old Red Bull driver is now one step away from that coronation as he prepares for Sunday's season finale under the floodlights of Abu Dhabi's Yas Marina circuit.
Level on points with Britain's Lewis Hamilton, the Mercedes great who is chasing a record eighth title, Verstappen leads 9-8 on wins.
That means he will become the first Dutch world champion by beating Hamilton or without scoring another point should the 36-year-old fail to finish in the top 10.
Belgian-born, Verstappen has been around the sport since he was a baby, on wheels almost as soon as he could walk and guided to grand prix greatness by the firm hand of father and former F1 racer Jos.
Verstappen senior took two podiums for Benetton in 1994 as a team mate to Michael Schumacher, and their families holidayed together.
Max's mother, Sophie Kumpen, was a top go-karter who raced against future F1 world champion Jenson Button and Red Bull team boss Christian Horner.
""Together Jos and Sophie built a baby which had the right genes,"" his former F3 team boss Frits van Amersfoort told the BBC. ""And then after a while Max was programmed to be a race driver.""
Verstappen has set F1 records as the youngest driver, points scorer and race winner (at 18) and can become the first non-Mercedes driver to take the title since Sebastian Vettel with Red Bull in 2013.
Hamilton saw the threat coming years ago.
""There’s always someone waiting to take my position. I’ve got that Max just sitting there waiting to take it,"" he said in 2017 after securing his fourth title.
""You’ve got for sure a potential world champion within Max and he’s only going to get stronger with age.""
POLES APART
That long-awaited battle of the generations became real this season as Red Bull and engine partner Honda finally provided Verstappen with the car his talents demanded.
While he and Hamilton are in a duel of their own, they are also poles apart.
Where the Briton is involved in fashion, music and using his platform as champion and F1's sole Black driver to push for racial equality and diversity, Verstappen has fewer distractions.
""Favourite hobby? That's a tricky one. Asides from F1, I do a lot of sim (virtual) racing. I guess that's a hobby,"" Verstappen said at last weekend's Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.
""But in a way also not because I take it very seriously.""
Verstappen is uncompromising and aggressive, although more relaxed than his father was, a racer who gets everything out of the car but sometimes crosses a line - literally and figuratively.
Hamilton said in Jeddah he felt Verstappen raced as if the rules did not apply to him while former racer Martin Brundle was also concerned by some of his moves.
""Such is Max's car control and cunning he's sometimes able to pull off the audacious moves and leave a margin of doubt as to whether it's hard racing or simply a professional foul outside of the regulations,"" said the Sky TV commentator.
Horner said people did not give Verstappen enough credit.
""Max drives like Tyson Fury fights. He’s got that same heart,"" he said recently.
""You just know he’s going to give it everything and if you knock him down, he’s going to get back up. He’s got that burning desire, that all-out commitment.""

Ferrari's 2007 world champion, now driving for Alfa Romeo, has one more race in Abu Dhabi on Sunday before he calls it quits at the age of 42.
""I'm looking forward to get the season done,"" the Finnish 'Iceman', who made his Formula One debut in 2001, told reporters at Yas Marina.
""It's nice that it comes to an end and I'm looking forward to the normal life after.
""I think for sure my wife will be more emotional about it,"" added the poker-faced winner of 21 races.
""I doubt that the kids will really care either way, I think they will find other things to do that are more interesting. They like coming to a warm country and be in a pool and other things but it’s nice to have them here.""
Raikkonen announced in September he would be retiring at the end of the season, with the Swiss-based team signing compatriot Valtteri Bottas as his replacement from Mercedes.
Alfa Romeo will be marking his final race with a special livery tribute on the side of his car declaring ""Dear Kimi, we will leave you alone now"".
Raikkonen famously uttered the phrase ""Just leave me alone, I know what I'm doing"" over the radio while heading to victory in Abu Dhabi with Lotus in 2012, a comment that spawned a range of merchandise and social media memes.
Ever popular with the fans, the Finn said he was looking forward to life without a rigid schedule.

The 32-year-old Perth native has not been back to Australia since 2020, with his home race in Melbourne cancelled for two seasons in a row due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""I'll be staring at a hotel room ceiling for two weeks,"" he told reporters at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Thursday when asked about his plans.
""I'm going to go home. I need to, I need to get home. But it's difficult. Unfortunately, they're not making it easy, but it is what it is. And I'll do that. I need to see family, friends.""
""Once I get out of the four walls, I should still get hopefully three or four weeks with friends and family. And it's summer, so something to look forward to.""
Ricciardo is ending his first season at McLaren after moving from Renault.
The Australian won the Italian Grand Prix in a one-two with Lando Norris, McLaren's first victory since 2012, but his form has been inconsistent.
He agreed it had been the biggest emotional rollercoaster of his career and said Monza was a career high, despite seven previous wins with Red Bull.
""The more time that passes since Monza the more actually, I realise the effect of that. And I really do think it was the biggest moment, win, race, kind of day, if you will, of my motorsport career,"" he said.
Ricciardo was replaced at Renault by double world champion Fernando Alonso, now 40 and making a comeback after two years out, and the Australian revealed the Spaniard had given him a gift in Abu Dhabi.

The Briton lapped the revised 5.2km-long Yas Marina track in 1 minute and 23.691 seconds, the only driver to drop below the 1:24 mark with his 24-year-old Dutch rival fourth.
The Red Bull driver had lapped fastest in Friday afternoon's opening session of track action with Hamilton, whose quickest lap time was deleted, third.
But the Dutchman could get no closer than 0.641 seconds off the Briton's benchmark in the evening, though he did appear to have the edge over Hamilton during the heavy-fuel race simulations.
Verstappen and Hamilton head into Sunday's race, a winner-takes-all showdown, level on points. But the Dutchman is ahead 9-8 on wins and will become champion if neither score.
The pair have already collided three times this season, raising concerns that a thrilling title battle might end in a crash.
But the governing FIA has warned drivers of severe consequences, such as a points deduction, for unsportsmanlike behaviour.
Alpine's Esteban Ocon took advantage of the Red Bull's relative lack of single-lap pace, going a surprise second fastest, 0.343 seconds adrift of Hamilton. Valtteri Bottas in the other Mercedes was third, 0.392 seconds off the pace. Kimi Raikkonen's crash in the closing minutes of the session forced an early halt.
The Finn, heading off into retirement on Sunday, lost control of his Alfa Romeo at the left-handed Turn 14 and spun into the barriers.
The 42-year-old, who ended the session 16th, walked away from the shunt, but his Alfa Romeo was a mangled mess.
Sergio Perez was fifth in the other Red Bull, ahead of Alpine's Fernando Alonso and Japanese rookie Yuki Tsunoda in his AlphaTauri.
Charles Leclerc was eighth ahead of Ferrari team mate Carlos Sainz.
Frenchman Pierre Gasly in the other AlphaTauri rounded out the top 10.
Williams reserve Jack Aitken replaced Mercedes-bound George Russell in the opening afternoon session just five months after having suffered a broken collarbone and fractured vertebra at the Spa 24 hours sports car race in Belgium, and set the 17th-fastest time.

The Paris-based International Automobile Federation (FIA) will vote on a successor to 75-year-old Todt next week, who is leaving after three terms of office.
Italy's Corriere della Sera reported last week that Todt, who presided over Ferrari's golden era in Formula One with Michael Schumacher, could return to Maranello as a super-consultant.
The paper said Todt, whose son Nicholas is manager to Ferrari's Monegasque driver Charles Leclerc, had already held discussions with Ferrari chairman John Elkann about a future role.
""I heard and I read about some speculation in that respect, but I can say that so far they are only speculations,"" Binotto told reporters at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
""Personally I worked with Jean Todt, he has been my boss, I think I learned a lot from him.
""It has been an honour to work with him and in case whatever would be the future it would still be an honour for me to work together with him, because I still believe that as Mattia and as a team there's still much to learn.""
The Corriere said Todt could have a similar role to the one triple world champion Niki Lauda had with champions Mercedes before his death in 2019.
Todt was at Ferrari from 1993 to 2009, presiding over 14 championships in total - including five successive drivers' crowns with Schumacher from 2000-04.

On Friday 37 clubs voted in favour of the ""LaLiga Boost"" deal that buys CVC an 8.2per cent stake in a new company that will get revenues from LaLiga broadcasting and sponsorship rights.
Real Madrid, Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Ibiza voted against the deal, one source close to the negotiations told Reuters. There was no immediate official statement from those clubs or details on their next moves.
At least 32 of the 42 teams from the Spanish first and second divisions needed to back the plan. On top of the four objections, one other club abstained from voting, the source said, without naming the club.
LaLiga had said the deal would be worth 2.7 billion euros when it was first unveiled in August. The lower 1.994 billion euro figure announced on Friday reflected the opt-outs and will be shared among the participating clubs and paid over a three-year period, the league said.
It marks the first investment agreement from a private equity firm in a major European League.
""This is a new milestone in the history of LaLiga and its clubs,"" LaLiga president Javier Tebas said. ""It allow us to continue our transformation towards a global digital entertainment company, improving the competition and enhancing the fan experience.""    
Goldman Sachs will contribute with a portion of the funds that CVC will invest in the Spanish football league and recover over 50 years, sources from LaLiga and the fund have said. 
The clubs are committed to allocate 70per cent of the funds to investments linked to new infrastructure and modernization projects. Up to 15per cent can be used to sign players, with the remaining 15per cent for reducing debt.
The deal looked like it was at risk of unravelling as Barcelona, Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao last week proposed an alternative proposal which would see JPMorgan, Bank of America and HSBC jointly lend 2 billion euros in exchange for a fixed annual payment of 115 million euros for 25 years, a document seen by Reuters showed. 
A source close to Real Madrid told Reuters the club will begin legal action against La Liga as they threatened when they announced their objection in August. The objecting clubs will not take any share of the CVC investment, though they will continue to receive their allocated share of TV rights money, LaLIGa said.
Barcelona and Real Madrid, who have yet to comment on the deal, were among the driving forces behind the failed plan to launch a breakaway European Super League earlier this year and vowed to continue to set it up after a Madrid court ruled against UEFA.
It is the third time CVC has tried to invest in a top European league, after separate plans with Italy's Serie A and Germany's Bundesliga to sell some media rights to it were scrapped earlier this year. 
CVC is also lining up preliminary bids for a stake in the French football league's media rights business, a source told Reuters this week.
CVC has invested in Formula 1, Moto GP and rugby and is reported by Sky News to be behind a new commercial venture that is preparing to merge the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and Women's Tennis Association (WTA).

The pair have collided three times already and are level on points going into the final race - only the second time that has happened and first since 1974 - with Verstappen 9-8 ahead on wins.
Social media is going full throttle with fans of each driver arguing over every twist and turn of the championship.
Rosberg felt his former team mate would come out on top ultimately.

""You kind of feel he has to be a little bit the favourite at the moment.""
The German said Hamilton was also effective at playing the media, with Red Bull boss Christian Horner on Friday casting the battle between the two contenders as Max versus the Mercedes machine nL4N2SV332.
""The media game is something you have to play if you want to win a world championship. It’s always like that because the media has such a power, even internally in the team,"" said Rosberg.
""Lewis is very, very good at that. His latest strategy has been to stay out of things, stay very low profile and just let the attention and pressure build on Max’s shoulders. And that has worked very well.
""Christian has to try and do what he can because for young Max it’s the first time he’s in a championship fight. It’s a big ask, against one of the greatest of all time.""

The pair are level on points in the standings, with Verstappen ahead 9-8 on race wins - meaning he will be champion regardless of where he finishes if Hamilton fails to score for any reason.

""It was a great team work,"" said Perez. ""Very pleased for Max that I managed to support him there.""
Hamilton's team mate Valtteri Bottas qualified only sixth in his last race for Mercedes.
Team boss Christian Horner said Verstappen's lap of one minute 22.109 seconds was one of his best of the year and the Dutch driver sounded remarkably relaxed given the amount of pressure on him.
""It's very important to have a good start and from there onwards we just try to do our race to the very best, then we'll see where we end up,"" said the 2020 race winner.
Hamilton had been fastest in practice and the first phase of qualifying but Verstappen was top in the second phase after he ""flat-spotted"" his set of medium tyres and switched to the soft Pirellis.
""The lockup wasn't ideal so it kind of forced our hand,"" said Horner.
Hamilton had lapped nearly half a second faster than Verstappen to top the first session ahead of Bottas, with both doing a run more than the Red Bull driver, but ended up with a best effort of 1:22.480.
The first phase was briefly halted for a loose bollard to be removed after it was hit by Haas driver Mick Schumacher and then run over by McLaren's Lando Norris.
George Russell, 17th, was outqualified by Williams team mate Nicholas Latifi in the Briton's final session before replacing Bottas next season.

Mazepin will not be replaced and Haas will run with only one driver, Mick Schumacher, because rules prohibit a driver who has not taken part in at least one session from racing on Sunday.
""Nikita is physically well, having been asymptomatic, but he will now self-isolate and adhere to the guidelines of the relevant public health authorities, with safety the ultimate priority for all parties concerned,"" the American team's statement said.
Mazepin, who was set to start last on the grid, is the eighth driver to have tested positive for COVID-19 since last season.
The 22-year-old, who will be staying at Haas alongside Schumacher next year, had appeared in a video released by Formula One on Saturday, urging people to get vaccinated.
Formula One teams have operated in a protective bubble with regular testing since last year, though protocols have been eased and fans allowed back at races in high numbers.

Hamilton's Mercedes team, who won the constructors' championship for an unprecedented eighth successive year but had their run of double dominance ended, protested about the result within half-an-hour of the chequered flag.
""It's insane,"" said Verstappen, Formula One's first Dutch world champion, of a race that started with the 24-year-old on pole position and level on points with Hamilton and ended in uproar.
Verstappen's hopes had sunk and risen as the stewards first refused to intervene and then decisively pushed the boundaries.
""This is unbelievable guys! Can we do this for another 10-15 years together?"" he had said over the radio after the most emotional lap of his life.
""We needed a bit of luck and we got it,"" said team boss Christian Horner, who had said earlier in the race that it would take a miracle to win.
""We are disappointed there has been a protest but we trust in the FIA.""
The floodlit race at Yas Marina avoided the collision many had feared, with Verstappen becoming champion if Hamilton failed to score, but instead left the battle raging off track.
As Verstappen and Red Bull bosses shed tears of joy, Mercedes's management turned on Australian race director Michael Masi as the drivers' title disappeared.
""Michael, this isn't right,"" said Mercedes principal Toto Wolff over the radio after the safety car rules were tweaked in Verstappen's favour.
The safety car was deployed after Canadian Nicholas Latifi crashed his Williams with five laps to go and Masi then decided not to demand all lapped cars pass it before resuming racing.
That allowed Verstappen - on fresher, faster tyres after strategic stops - to close and go wheel-to-wheel with Hamilton for the lead.
At one point it had seemed the race would be finishing behind the safety car, which would have handed Hamilton the title instead.
""We were screaming at the end to let them race,"" said Horner, whose partners Honda are now departing the sport. ""It is unheard of to leave the cars unlapped. They wanted to get the race going again. They absolutely made the right call.""",['387_0'],['\nMax Verstappen won the Formula One world title for the first time. (Photo: Pool/AFP/KAMRAN JEBREILI)\n']

385,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/timeline-season-ending-abu-dhabi-grand-prix-2375111,Timeline of season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix,"Red Bull's Max Verstappen won a maiden Formula One title after a last-lap overtake on Mercedes rival Lewis Hamilton at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Here is how the showdown between the pair played out:
Start: Hamilton gets a better launch and leads into the first corner. 
L1: Verstappen, pulled along in Hamilton’s slipstream makes a lunge for the lead into the Turn 6-7 chicane. Hamilton takes to the run off and keeps the lead.
Verstappen on the team radio: ""He has to give that back!""
Hamilton on the team radio: ""He pushed me off track.""
Mercedes respond: ""We’re happy with the gap you’ve established.""
Stewards determine no investigation necessary into the incident.
Verstappen on the team radio: “That is incredible, what are they doing here?”
Red Bull sporting director Jonathan Wheatley complains to FIA race director Michael Masi: “Michael we still don’t understand it. That was a hard, aggressive pass by Max but Max stayed fully on the track and was ahead at the apex.”
Masi replies: ""Jonathan, the Stewards have reviewed it and determined that all of the lasting advantage was (given back) and that Max forced that position there. They’ve reviewed it but they’re not investigating it.""
L10: Hamilton establishes 2.7-second advantage on Verstappen. Verstappen, who started on the more fragile soft tyre to Hamilton’s more durable medium, is beginning to lose grip.
L12: ""Rear tyres are really struggling,"" reports Verstappen.
L14: Verstappen pits, swaps his soft tyres for the hard compound (2.1s), rejoins fifth 28 seconds behind Hamilton 
L15: Mercedes bring Hamilton in for the hard tyre. Hamilton rejoins second behind Red Bull’s Sergio Perez, and is five seconds ahead of Verstappen who is fourth.  
L16: Red Bull tell Perez they are switching him to Plan B on strategy, presumably keeping him out longer to slow Hamilton down.
L16: Verstappen, trying to find his way past the Ferrari of Carlos Sainz, runs off track and loses time.
L18: Verstappen passes Sainz to move back into the top three. Perez leads with Verstappen 8.2 seconds behind Hamilton in third.
L19: Red Bull tell Perez: ""We’ll be looking to hold up Lewis"". Hamilton is roughly two seconds a lap faster.
L20: Hamilton, on the fresher tyres, passes Perez but the Mexican uses the slipstream and DRS to drive back past.
Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff to race director Masi: ""Michael, it’s a bit dangerous, can you warn them?,"" Masi responds saying it’s fair racing.
L21: Hamilton passes Perez but the Mexican’s strategic driving has brought Verstappen back on to Hamilton’s tail. The gap between the rivals is 1.9 seconds. 
L21: ""Checo is a legend,"" Verstappen says on the radio using Perez’s nickname.
L23: Hamilton sets fastest lap and the Briton has opened a 2.8-second gap on Verstappen.
L27: Finland’s Kimi Raikkonen, a fan favourite driving in his last race, retires with a brake failure.
L29: Hamilton sets fastest lap to extend advantage over Verstappen to 4.2 seconds.
L30: Hamilton’s team mate Valtteri Bottas pits, opening up a gap for Verstappen to pit into and keep second place.
L32: Hamilton sets another fastest lap. Gap to Verstappen 5.2 seconds.
L36: Giovinazzi stops by side of the track. Virtual Safety Car (VSC) deployed so the stranded Alfa Romeo can be cleared. 
Hamilton’s gap to Verstappen is 6.7 seconds.
Hamilton is told he will not be pitting under the VSC.
L36: Verstappen takes advantage of the VSC to pit for a second time for a new set of hard tyres. 
L37: Toto Wolff to race director Masi: ""Michael, please no safety car, interferes in the race."" A safety car would bunch the pack up, putting Verstappen, on fresh tyres, right on Hamilton’s tail.
L37: Virtual Safety Car ends. Hamilton leads by 17.9 seconds.
L38: Verstappen sets fastest lap, Verstappen is 0.8 seconds faster.  
L39: Verstappen sets another fastest lap, gap to Hamilton down to 15.5 seconds. ""I won’t be able to keep this pace up the whole way,"" Hamilton tells Mercedes.
L50: Gap between Hamilton and Verstappen down to 11 seconds, as Hamilton makes his way through backmarker traffic.
L53: Williams driver Nicholas Latifi crashes at Turn 14. The Safety Car is deployed. There are five laps to go.
Verstappen pits for the third time, puts on soft tyres.
""That’s unbelievable man,"" says Hamilton, who will now be on worn hard tyres with Verstappen right on his tail on newer, more grippy softs.
""This field has to bunch and they have to send the lapped cars through so it may not restart,"" Mercedes say.
L56: Sergio Perez, who also pitted behind the Safety Car, is asked to retire his car.
L56: Lapped cars will not be allowed to overtake, says race control. That means racing can get underway sooner but with slower cars between Verstappen and Hamilton.  
""Yeah, of course, typical decision. I’m not surprised,” Verstappen responds when told of race control’s decision.
Red Bull team boss Christian Horner on the radio to Michael Masi: ""Why aren’t we getting these lapped cars out of the way?"" 
L57: SC is called in, lapped cars are released, Verstappen is right behind Hamilton as the race is about to resume.
""Michael this isn’t right,"" Toto Wolff says on the radio to Masi.
Final lap: Verstappen lunges down at Turn 5 and takes the lead.
Wolff in exasperation to Masi: ""No Michael! No, no! This is not right.""
Hamilton goes wheel to wheel with Verstappen into Turn 9. But Verstappen keeps the position. 
Finish: Verstappen wins the race and the world championship. Mercedes clinch a record eighth constructors' title.
Christian Horner on the radio to Verstappen: ""Max Verstappen you are the world champion. Max we are so proud of you. You have driven like a champion all year, you deserve that, we needed a bit of luck you got it, you made it happen and we love you, we absolutely love you."" 
Verstappen: ""Oh my God guys! I love you so much.""

The 36-year-old, who started second alongside pole-sitter Verstappen, appeared to have the race well under control after seizing the lead into the first corner and escaping sanction for staying ahead by taking to the run-off in an opening-lap battle with his Red Bull rival.
But a safety car five laps from the end, that handed Verstappen the opportunity to pit for fresh tyres, turned the race on its head and put an end to Hamilton's hopes of becoming the first driver to win eight world championships.
""Firstly, a big congratulations to Max and to his team,"" said Hamilton, his eyes moist, after the race.
""I think we did an amazing job this year. My team, everyone back at the factory... all the men and women... have worked so hard this whole year. It's been the most difficult of seasons.
""I'm so proud of them, so grateful to be a part of the journey with them,"" added the Briton, who has won the title for the last four years in a row and ended the season with eight wins to his Red Bull rival's 10.
But, even as Verstappen celebrated and Hamilton came to terms with defeat, the Briton's Mercedes team lodged two safety-car related protests.
One had to do with Verstappen pulling up alongside and edging ahead of Hamilton; the other with the resumption of racing.
Race control initially said the lapped cars, acting as a buffer between Hamilton and Verstappen would not be allowed to overtake, much to Red Bull's frustration.
But they later decided to let only those cars through, putting Verstappen right on Hamilton's tail for one final flat-out lap, with the Dutchman seizing his chance on his fresh soft tyres to pass Hamilton for the lead.
Stewards dismissed both protests. Mercedes lodged their intention to appeal against the dismissal of their protest related to the safety car restart.
""We gave it everything, this last part of the season we gave it absolutely everything and we never gave up,"" said Hamilton. ""That's the most important thing.""",['384_0'],"[""\nFormula One F1 - Abu Dhabi Grand Prix - Yas Marina Circuit, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates - December 12, 2021 Red Bull's Max Verstappen celebrates winning the race and the world championship with the Netherlands flag on the podium as Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton looks dejected after finishing second REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed\n""]"
383,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/verstappen-fulfils-his-destiny-dream-f1-title-2375296,Verstappen fulfils his destiny with dream F1 title,"Max Verstappen was hailed as a future Formula One world champion even before he entered the sport as a 17-year-old rookie in 2015 and on Sunday, whooping in delight, he fulfilled his destiny in dramatic style.
The 24-year-old Dutch driver, followed around the world by a raucous army of orange-shirted fans, overtook Mercedes's seven-times champion Lewis Hamilton on the last lap of the final race in Abu Dhabi.
""Max Verstappen, you are the world champion. The world champion,"" Red Bull boss Christian Horner shouted over the radio in a release of pent-up tension and stress, as Verstappen sobbed tears of joy.
""You have driven like a champion all year. You deserved that. You have made it happen and we absolutely love you.""
It looked like the ending of an era, the passing of a baton even if 36-year-old Hamilton no doubt intends to take it back next year, as the rivals sportingly embraced before taking the podium.
""It's insane, I'm so happy,"" said Verstappen.
""My goal when I was little was to become a Formula One driver and you hope for wins, you hope to be on the podium; when they play the national anthem you hope they play yours.
""And then when they stand here and they tell you you are the world champion it's just something incredible. All the things come back to your mind, all of the years travelling for that goal.""
Formula One's first Dutch world champion, although he is Belgian born, has grabbed the title by the throat this season and given Hamilton his first real, down-to-the-wire rival from outside his own team.
Verstappen has motor racing in his blood, a born racer who has been around the sport since he was a baby and was on wheels almost as soon as he could walk.
Naturally talented, he is also determined and driven, a reflection of the firm hand of father and former F1 racer Jos, while also keeping his feet on the ground.
As he progressed through karting there was only ever one destination.
Jos took two podiums for Benetton in 1994 as a team mate to Michael Schumacher, and the families holidayed together, but he retired without coming close to the success he felt his talent deserved and that his son has delivered.
Max's mother, Sophie Kumpen, was a top go-karter who raced against future F1 world champion Jenson Button.
Verstappen has F1 records as youngest driver, points scorer and race winner (at 18) and is the first non-Mercedes driver to take the title since Sebastian Vettel with Red Bull in 2013.
Hamilton saw the threat coming years ago.
""There’s always someone waiting to take my position. I’ve got that Max just sitting there waiting to take it,"" he said in 2017 after securing his fourth title.
While the two rivals have been locked in a duel for the ages, one that will go down as one of the sport's greatest, they are poles apart.
Where the Briton is involved in fashion, music and using his platform as champion and F1's sole Black driver to push for racial equality and diversity, Verstappen has fewer distractions.
""Favourite hobby? That's a tricky one. Asides from F1, I do a lot of sim (virtual) racing. I guess that's a hobby,"" Verstappen said at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.
""But in a way also not because I take it very seriously.""
Verstappen is also a racer who sometimes crosses a line, literally and figuratively.
Hamilton said in Jeddah he felt Verstappen raced as if the rules did not apply to him but Horner said that was not the case.
""Max drives like Tyson Fury fights. He’s got that same heart,"" he said recently.
""You just know he’s going to give it everything and if you knock him down, he’s going to get back up. He’s got that burning desire, that all-out commitment.""","['383_0', '383_1', '383_2']","[""\n      Formula One F1 - Abu Dhabi Grand Prix - Yas Marina Circuit, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates - December 12, 2021 Red Bull's Max Verstappen celebrates winning the race and the world championship REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed\n    "", ""\n      Formula One F1 - Abu Dhabi Grand Prix - Yas Marina Circuit, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates - December 12, 2021 Red Bull's Max Verstappen celebrates winning the race and the world championship with the Netherlands flag on the podium as Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton looks dejected after finishing second REUTERS/Rula Rouhana\n    "", ""\n      Formula One F1 - Abu Dhabi Grand Prix - Yas Marina Circuit, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates - December 12, 2021 Red Bull's Max Verstappen celebrates winning the race and the world championship with the Netherlands flag and team principal Christian Horner on the podium REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed\n    ""]"

The former F1 racer also revealed he had walked away at one point in a race of changing fortunes when it looked like the dream was over.
""Because of the safety car we are in this position but still you have to do it,"" Jos told Sky Sports television after his son overtook Hamilton on the last lap of a dramatic and controversial race.
""I think the team had a good strategy on that as well, they called him in. They are doing a lot of things very good and I think Max was the driver this year and he really deserved this championship.
""He kept fighting. He will always fight. That's in his DNA, I guess... he said to me 'every lap I was flat out' and he was driving to the maximum. And then he had one chance, one lap and that's what he took.""
Verstappen had started the race level on points with Hamilton but 9-8 ahead on wins, and there were fears a collision could settle the outcome.
They came close to contact but stayed apart, Hamilton leading but Verstappen brought back into play by strategic pitstops and the safety car just when his hopes appeared to be over.
""During the race I walked away because I didn't believe it any more. But I came back the last lap,"" said Jos, a team mate of future seven-times world champion Michael Schumacher at Benetton in 1994.
He also drove for Benetton, Simtek, Arrows, Tyrrell, Stewart and Minardi before retiring in 2003.

Heartbreak for Hamilton after Red Bull title rival Max Verstappen beat him to the win and the title in a safety-car aided last-lap pass.
The Briton, starting second, had seized the lead from the pole-sitting Red Bull into the first corner and until the safety car on lap 53 of 58 had appeared in control of the race and well on his way to an unprecedented eighth title.
The resumption of the race, to allow for one final lap of flat-out racing has sparked controversy, with Mercedes lodging two separate protests.
Stewards dismissed both, but Mercedes has lodged its intention to appeal against the dismissal of its protest related to the safety car restart.   
Bottas, in his last race for the team ahead of a move to Alfa Romeo next year, finished sixth. It was enough to help Mercedes clinch a record eighth straight constructors' title.
Verstappen needed a miracle to salvage his title hopes and the racing gods duly delivered with a perfectly-timed safety car that allowed the Dutchman to pit for fresh tyres.
His last-lap overtake for the lead on the newer rubber clinched the 24-year-old's first title.
Perez played a strong supporting role, holding up Hamilton after the first pit-stops, but was ultimately called in by Red Bull to retire the car. The Mexican was, however, classified 15th.
Sainz finished third to round out his first year with the Italian glamour team with four podium finishes. Leclerc scored a sole point in 10th.
The sport's most successful team, Ferrari ended the season on a high, wrapping up third in the constructors' standings ahead of McLaren and cementing a strong recovery from a difficult season last year.
Norris started the race a promising third but ran wide at the first corner and lost positions. The Briton ended the race seventh. Ricciardo started 10th but finished outside the points in 12th.
Still, the former champions had plenty of highlights to celebrate in 2021, including their first win since 2012 at the Italian Grand Prix, which was also their first one-two result since 2010.
The Renault-owned French manufacturer wrapped up fifth in the constructors' standings with both cars finishing the race in the points.
Tsunoda ended a difficult rookie campaign with his best finish of the season in fourth. Team mate Gasly backed that up in fifth, delivering a strong double-points finish for Red Bull's Italian sister team. Still, it was not enough to beat midfield rivals Alpine to a top-five finish in the constructors' standings.
The Silverstone-based team failed to score, with both cars finishing outside the points. Vettel lost time stuck behind Giovinazzi while Stroll was left frustrated at race control's decision to let only some of the lapped cars go past the leaders under the safety car.
Neither of the Grove-based team's two cars finished the race. Russell parked up in the pits after losing drive on the 27th lap. Latifi's crash on lap 53 brought out the controversial race-deciding safety car.
Alfa Romeo also failed to get its cars to the finish. Kimi Raikkonen, driving in his last race, was the first retirement on Sunday, parking up with a brake failure after just 25 laps.
Giovinazzi, on his way to Formula E after being replaced by Chinese rookie Guanyu Zhou for next year, pulled over only a few laps later with what appeared to be a malfunctioning gearbox.
Schumacher, son of seven-times champion and Ferrari great Michael, ended his rookie season with a 14th-placed finish. Team mate Mazepin was ruled out ahead of the start after the Russian tested positive for COVID-19.

Verstappen passed Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton on the last lap to win the race after a safety car period ended in controversial circumstances.
""THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!!!!,"" Williams driver George Russell, who is set to join Mercedes in the coming season, tweeted.
""Max is an absolutely fantastic driver who has had an incredible season and I have nothing but huge respect for him, but what just happened is absolutely unacceptable. 
""I cannot believe what we've just seen.""
Former Formula One champion Damon Hill also criticised the decision.
""This is a new way of running the sport where the race director can make these ad hoc decisions,"" Hill said.
There was criticism from beyond the motor racing world too, with Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane saying the championship had been taken away from Hamilton.
""I'm no expert on it but I feel like there's some bizarre rules that give an unfair advantage like today? Why should Hamilton be penalised for somebody else's crash?"" Kane said on Twitter.
""He literally raced the perfect race under the highest pressure and gets the world championship taken away from him. Shame it had to end like that.""
However, Verstappen's achievement drew praise from several former drivers, with three-time champion Jackie Stewart congratulating the 24-year-old. 
""I think it's great that we have a new world champion, because Lewis has had a wonderful run,"" Stewart told Eurosport.
""Red Bull and Max are very well put together and I think they're going to be seeing considerable success in the future.""

They could end up debated in court if Lewis Hamilton's outraged Mercedes team, who had a top barrister on hand after the race, follow through on their intention to appeal the outcome.
Nobody doubts Verstappen is a worthy winner, with the Dutch 24-year-old and seven-times champion Hamilton giving their all in one of the most exciting seasons.
The circumstances that led to the final victory were highly controversial, however, and put Masi - appointed after the sudden death in 2019 of highly-respected predecessor Charlie Whiting - ever more in the firing line.
With the safety car deployed near the end, the Australian ruled that lapped cars would not be allowed to unlap themselves before racing resumed. 
Breaking with protocol, he then decreed that only the five lapped cars between Verstappen and Hamilton rather than all could do so.
That set up one last lap of racing with Verstappen, who had seized the opportunity to pit for fresher tyres while Hamilton stayed out, getting a clear run and passing the Briton seven corners from the end.
""This is a new way of running the sport where the Race Director can make these ad hoc decisions. Its been a bit too 'guess what I'm going to do now' I think,"" said 1996 world champion Damon Hill.
Williams driver George Russell, who is joining Mercedes, said what happened was 'absolutely unacceptable'.
Nico Rosberg, the 2016 champion for Mercedes, was conflicted.
""I guess Michael Masi can decide what he wants and he’s the director,"" the German told Sky Sports television, while adding that Mercedes had tailored their strategy to a rule that was then suddenly changed.
Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff did not talk to the media after the race. 
GREY AREAS 
The regulations, much thumbed on Sunday night, leave some grey areas.
The required instruction 'lapped cars may now overtake' was not given and the race director, under a separate rule, has 'overriding authority' when it comes to the safety car.
After a rain-hit Belgian Grand Prix that was ridiculed after lasting only a few laps behind the safety car, Masi could be understood for not wanting a thrilling season to finish with a procession.
He has also been cast more into the limelight by radio communications between teams and race director being broadcast for the first time this season.
Whiting, who pretty much wrote the rulebook, was never exposed to such scrutiny.
In Saudi Arabia, the race before Abu Dhabi, there was a messy negotiation with Red Bull about Verstappen's grid position at a re-start that raised doubts about Masi's authority.
It sounded, said Red Bull boss Christian Horner, like haggling in a local market although Formula One managing director Ross Brawn backed Masi's pragmatic approach.
Button recognised few would want to be in the race director's shoes.
""He wants to get them racing. He doesn’t want to decide the world championship. It’s a really tricky one but we saw a race,"" said the Briton.    
The producers of the 'Drive to Survive', the Netflix documentary series credited with boosting Formula One's popularity worldwide and particularly in America, will not be complaining.

The 24-year-old handed Red Bull their first title since 2013 in Abu Dhabi on Sunday when he overtook Mercedes' seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton on the last lap of the final race of the season.
Mercedes had two protests dismissed but have signalled they intend to take the matter further.
Hamilton and his father Anthony congratulated Verstappen and father Jos after the race but Wolff stayed out of sight.
""Toto sent me a text, congratulations on the season and that I deserved to win it, so that was very nice of him of course,"" Verstappen, slightly worse for wear after a long night of partying, told reporters on a video call on Monday.
""Lewis is a great sportsman in general. He came up to me and congratulated me and it must have been of course very tough in that last lap,"" he added.
""But it also shows the respect we have for each other.
""Of course we had our tough times throughout the season but in the end we respect what we were doing and we were pushing each other to the limit the whole season. It has been really enjoyable racing against him.""
Verstappen had to wait some hours for the stewards to dismiss the protests but then it was party time with the whole team, from engineers to caterers, celebrating into the dawn.
""Of course when I woke up that was not so fun. I regretted maybe that final drink,"" said Verstappen. ""I think a lot of people have a headache at the moment.""
The champion admitted to some nerves on Saturday night, when he was itching for the battle to start, but he had managed to sleep.
There was no disappointment in the race finishing amid controversy, a safety car period ending just in time for one crucial lap of racing thanks to the intervention of race director Michael Masi.
""I think it just sums up the whole season in general. It’s been pretty crazy and intense,"" said Verstappen.",['378_0'],"[""\nFormula One F1 - Abu Dhabi Grand Prix - Yas Marina Circuit, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates - December 12, 2021 Red Bull's Max Verstappen celebrates winning the race and the world championship with the Netherlands flag on the podium as Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton looks dejected after finishing second REUTERS/Ahmed Jadallah\n""]"

Paul Lemmens, whose Karting Genk circuit is known as the 'Home of Champions', recalled first meeting the four-year-old Verstappen when father and former F1 racer Jos brought him along to test a baby kart.
""It was amazing to see because his helmet was bigger than himself,"" he told Reuters television a day after Red Bull's 24-year-old Verstappen won the title nL1N2SX080 in Abu Dhabi.
""The father Jos was racing also in my team and for that he started here. He lived also in Belgium about 15km from here so each weekend or each day they had off they were on track with Max.""
Lemmens said Max's talents were soon apparent.
""He did many, many races here, and most of them he won easily,"" Lemmens added.
""He did his first race and he won immediately ... from then on you can see he had an extreme talent. Then the next race he won also. I don't think he lost one race - only when his engine was broken or something like that.
""The other competitors, when they started here and they knew Max was here, they knew they were going for second place,"" said Lemmens.  
The international circuit, which has hosted the karting world championships, attracts plenty of youngsters as well as some established drivers.
Lemmens said seven times world champion Michael Schumacher would come for practice even as a Formula One driver while Jenson Button, Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen also raced there on the way up.

Mercedes are still deciding whether to appeal the result of the race and have until Thursday, the night Verstappen is due to receive the champion's trophy at a gala awards ceremony in Paris.

As America's Cup yachts have evolved into high-speed, ""foiling"" machines which ""fly"" above the water on hydrofoils, the adrenaline fuelled sport has increasingly been referred to as Formula One on water and is now using much of the same technology and design, as well as attracting its cash.
Alinghi, founded by billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli, won the America's Cup in 2003 and 2007 but have not competed for the oldest trophy in international sport in over a decade. Holders Emirates Team New Zealand have already been challenged by Ben Ainslie's INEOS Britannia and others are expected to follow.
Alinghi Red Bull Racing will represent the Societe Nautique de Geneve yacht club in its challenge for the 37th America's Cup, which is due to be held in 2024, the new team said in a statement which coincided with a launch event in Geneva.
Despite being land-locked, Switzerland has attracted top talent since Bertarelli set his sights on sailing's most coveted prize, as well as spawning a generation of home-grown stars.
""We want for this challenge to do something totally different, totally new, totally fresh,"" Bertarelli said, describing Red Bull, which has been a rival in events such as the GC32 and Extreme Sailing, as providing the ""wings"".
A core crew led by Alinghi's GC32 co-skipper Arnaud Psarofaghis will begin training to prepare ""a 100 per cent Swiss Made crew"", the team said on Tuesday.
Red Bull Racing principal Christian Horner said Red Bull Advanced Technologies would share experiences and engineering tips with Alinghi Red Bull Racing in a ""two-way cooperation"".
For Alinghi's Brad Butterworth, a four-time winner of the America's Cup, the Red Bull partnership marks a new chapter.
""The America's Cup is a technology race which is won on the water with race strategy and tactics. Red Bull has demonstrated that time and time again in F1 and in many of the other sports it competes in,"" Butterworth said.","['374_0', '374_1', '374_2', '374_3']","[""\n      FILE PHOTO: Crew member of America's Cup defender Alinghi 5 of Switzerland work in the boat as they wait for the start of Race 1 at the 33rd America's Cup off the coast of Valencia February 12, 2010.

The season that ended seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton's reign and handed the crown to Dutch youngster Max Verstappen amid raging controversy was one that had it all and just kept on giving.
The closest of battles went down to the very last lap of the last race, Red Bull's Verstappen and Mercedes' Hamilton level on points and going wheel-to-wheel seven corners from the final chequered flag.
Red Bull boss Christian Horner, who had his own battles with Mercedes counterpart Toto Wolff, had no doubt the sport owed him plenty.
Asked about Formula One chief executive Stefano Domenicali's first year in the job, Horner told reporters: ""I think he needs to buy Red Bull an enormous Christmas hamper for the excitement, for the racing, for the drama that he's had in charge.
""I don't think even a Hollywood scriptwriter could have come up with the ins and outs of this year. Formula One's popularity has gone through the roof ... and the amount of new fans that we've welcomed into the sport has been astounding.""
Next season will see revamped regulations and new-looking cars designed to improve overtaking.
The jury remains out on that but not on Verstappen - winner of 10 races this year and on the podium a record 18 times in a single season - or Hamilton, who remains a fearsome and outspoken competitor at 36.
The Briton came to the fore as a role model, sporting in defeat, and campaigner standing up for equal rights and diversity.
There are improvements to be made, not least in the consistency of decisions by stewards and the role of race director Michael Masi.
There are concerns also that the sport has been changed by the hugely popular Netflix Drive to Survive documentary series, and is sacrificing integrity for entertainment.
On the positive side, Ferrari returned to the top three after a dire 2020 while McLaren won for the first time since 2012 and Alpine's Esteban Ocon celebrated a first win.
If McLaren's Daniel Ricciardo endured a rollercoaster season, winning at Monza but struggling elsewhere, his young British team mate Lando Norris had a standout year.
Kimi Raikkonen, the 2007 champion with Ferrari, retired after 349 races and 19 seasons in the sport.
The Finn's place at Alfa Romeo will be taken by compatriot Valtteri Bottas, Hamilton's loyal but regularly-beaten team mate whose Mercedes seat goes to George Russell in an all-British lineup.
Italy's sole representative Antonio Giovinazzi departed, replaced by China's first Guanyu Zhou.
Red Bull's engine partners Honda, winning a drivers' title for the first time since the late Brazilian triple champion Ayrton Senna at McLaren in 1991, depart but leave their technology behind.
Middle Eastern involvement also grew, with Qatar and Saudi Arabia both making their debuts in 2021 alongside established races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi.","['373_0', '373_1', '373_2']","[""\n      Red Bull's Max Verstappen celebrates winning the race and the world championship with the trophy on the podium, Yas Marina Circuit, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirate, Dec 12, 2021.

The 22-year-old arrived on the grid as Formula Two champion and with plenty of hype but last-placed Haas have been outgunned all year, the only team to finish with a blank.
Despite that, Schumacher quietly got on with the job of learning the ropes and without feeling any pressure of expectation.
""I'm confident to say that I feel very comfortable in my skin and in my position,"" the German told a round table of select media before the season ended in Abu Dhabi last weekend.
""I feel like we've extracted the maximum out of the car. I feel that we have been with each event improving.""
Schumacher's season highlights include making it past the first knockout phase of qualifying in changeable conditions in Turkey and a wheel-to-wheel battle with Red Bull's Max Verstappen, now champion, in Hungary.
""I'm doing whatever I can and do it my best way I can,"" he said.
""Yes, I came in with my surname but at the end also I had results behind me. I was able to prove my way into Formula One. If I add a legacy or not, that's up to my own career, up to myself at the end.""
Ferrari great Michael Schumacher, who has not been seen in public since suffering severe head injuries in a skiing accident in 2013, won 91 races, 68 pole positions and 155 podiums.
Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton, who on Sunday missed out on an unprecedented eighth title, has since claimed most of Schumacher's records.
It would be unrealistic to expect Mick, a member of the Ferrari Driver Academy, to reach the same dizzying heights.
He has acquitted himself well against Russian rookie team mate Nikita Mazepin, however, and Ferrari will be looking for a step up in his second season.
Haas use Ferrari engines, gearboxes and components and Schumacher's placement has always been with the eventual aim of one day driving for the Italian team even if that remains a distant prospect.
""Obviously the history with my father binds me a lot to it,"" said Schumacher of an eventual move to Maranello. ""If that's the place where I end up then I don't know. That's a question which is far in the future right now.

It outlined key objectives and a framework for the regulations in a statement after a meeting in Paris.
Four key pillars were listed: keeping the 1.6-litre V6 engine, increasing electrical power to 350kW, eliminating the MGU-H component which generates energy from heat and introducing a power unit cost cap.
The FIA said it wanted to send a powerful environmental message, with 100per cent sustainable fuel and ""shift of focus to electrical power"".
It also wanted to make it possible for new power unit manufacturers to join the sport at a competitive level.
Formula One currently has only Mercedes, Ferrari and Renault while Red Bull are taking over Honda's technology after the Japanese manufacturer's exit at the end of this year.
Volkswagen Group, which owns Audi and Porsche, has reportedly discussed entering Formula One, with any decision resting on whether the sport follows through on plans to switch to synthetic fuels by 2026.   
The FIA said details of the 2026 Power Unit Regulations would be developed and submitted to the World Motor Sport Council in early 2022.

His team mates gathered around him and looked on while millions of people watched on television after the midfielder collapsed.

Red Bull's Verstappen, 24, seized the title after overtaking seven-time world champion Hamilton on the last lap of the race amid uproar over how a late safety car period was conducted.
The Dutch driver is due to collect his trophy at a gala awards ceremony in Paris on Thursday evening (Dec 16).
Mercedes welcomed the governing FIA's decision, announced on Wednesday, to analyse what happened at Yas Marina and bring clarity for the future.
""We will hold the FIA accountable for this process and we hereby withdraw our appeal,"" the team said.
Mercedes had announced their intention to appeal after two post-race protests were dismissed. The deadline was Thursday evening.
""We left Abu Dhabi in disbelief of what we had just witnessed. Of course, it's part of the game to lose a race, but it's something different when you lose faith in racing,"" Mercedes said.
""Together with Lewis, we have deliberated carefully over how to respond to the events ... we have always been guided by our love of this sport and we believe that every competition should be won on merit.
""In the race on Sunday, many felt, us included, that the way things unfolded was not right.""
The safety car was deployed five laps from the end after Canadian Nicholas Latifi crashed his Williams, with marshals needing to be on track to recover it.
Racing resumed with one lap remaining after race director Michael Masi broke with a protocol requiring all lapped cars should overtake the safety car first.
Instead, only those between Verstappen and Hamilton unlapped themselves, giving the Red Bull driver a clear track to close on Hamilton and overtake.
Hamilton had not pitted, unlike Verstappen, when the safety car was deployed because he would have lost the lead and Mercedes calculated there was not enough time remaining to resume racing under the rules.
""We appealed in the interest of sporting fairness,"" said Mercedes.
""We have since been in a constructive dialogue with the FIA and Formula 1 to create clarity for the future, so that all competitors know the rules under which they are racing, and how they will be enforced.
""To Max Verstappen and Red Bull Racing - we would like to express our sincere respect for your achievements this season,"" the team added.
""You made this Formula 1 championship title fight truly epic. Max, we congratulate you and your entire team. We look forward to taking the fight to you on the track next season.""

Red Bull's Max Verstappen will be handed his trophy at the ceremony and the top three drivers are obliged to attend the prizegiving under article 6.6 of the Formula One sporting regulations.

""It's going to take a long time for us to digest what has happened on Sunday. I don't think we will ever come over it, that's not possible,"" said Wolff.
""And certainly not him (Hamilton) as a driver. I would very much hope the two of us and the rest of the team we can work through the events... But he will never overcome the pain and the distress that was caused on Sunday.""
Hamilton spoke briefly after Sunday's race to 2009 world champion Jenson Button before the podium ceremonies but did no media post-race and has not spoken publicly since.
He also avoided saying anything after being knighted at Windsor Palace on Wednesday.
CLEAR VALUES
Asked directly whether Hamilton, who turns 37 in January and has two years remaining on his contract, would be back next year, Wolff indicated that was not a certainty.
""I would very much hope Lewis continues racing because he is the greatest driver of all time,"" he said.
""As a racer his heart will say I need to continue because he's at the peak of his game,"" he added. ""But we have to overcome the pain that was caused upon him on Sunday. He is a man with clear values.""
Mercedes won the constructors' title for an unprecedented eighth year in a row and Wolff said technical head James Allison would be in Paris to collect the trophy on behalf of all the workforce.
""I won't be there because of my loyalty to Lewis and because of my own personal integrity,"" he said.
Wolff was confident Mercedes could have won a legal battle but there was ""a difference between right and obtaining justice.""
He said every decision was taken with Hamilton.
""It was tremendously hard for him and for us as a team to withdraw the appeal, because we were wronged,"" he added.
""My soul and my heart cries with every bone that this should have been judged in the right way.""
Wolff said there had been no contact with race director Michael Masi, who made the safety car decision, since Sunday.
""I'm not interested in having a conversation with Michael Masi,"" he said.
""The decisions that have been taken in the last four minutes of this race have robbed Lewis Hamilton of a deserved world championship. He won the start and he never gave the lead away again.
""Robbing him on the last lap of the race is unacceptable ... my values, my sense of integrity, just isn't compatible with the decisions that have been made on Sunday.""

A wave of new infections, driven by the new Omicron variant of coronavirus, suggested more postponements and cancellations will follow as sporting codes warily await the impact.
The Premier League fixture list was thrown into chaos as six games were postponed due to COVID-19 outbreaks taking the total for the past week to nine but league officials intend to continue with the schedule where safely possible as new COVID-19 cases in Britain hit a record for the second day running on Thursday.
The Premier League found a record 42 cases of COVID-19 among players and staff at various clubs this week, leading Brentford manager Thomas Frank to suggest all this weekend’s games should be postponed as cases “are going through the roof”.
With 13 new positive cases at his club, Frank told a news conference: ""To postpone this round would give everyone a week at least, or four or five days to clean and do everything at the training ground so everything is clean and you break the chain.""
Amid a multitude of postponements in England's lower leagues, the Football League (EFL) on Thursday ordered clubs to implement enhanced safety protocols for training, with social distancing and restrictions on the use of indoor facilities, manual therapy and group travel.
LaLiga leaders Real Madrid were struck a blow when four more players tested positive on Thursday to add to Luka Modric and Marcelo, who had been forced into quarantine some 24 hours earlier. But Sunday’s home game against Cadiz is going ahead.
Rugby’s European Champions Cup has also been hit with Montpellier’s game at home to Leinster the latest to be postponed over COVID cases in both squads, while Welsh club Ospreys suggested their trip to Racing 92 in Paris could also be off with at least seven positive cases in their camp.
Over the last three days, the National Football League, National Hockey League and National Basketball Association have faced a surge in positive tests, with more expected on Thursday, forcing players into league mandated COVID-19 protocols and the postponement of games.
The holiday season across the United States and Canada is usually filled with sporting action but, with the coronavirus spreading through locker rooms, fans may not see all their favourite players.
Australia captain Pat Cummins had to miss the second Ashes cricket test, which started in Adelaide on Thursday, after a close contact with someone who tested positive for the virus.
West Indies' tour of Pakistan was cut short after the number of positive COVID-19 cases in the touring party rose to nine.
A third T20 international went ahead on Thursday but the three-match One Day International series to follow is now off.

His Mercedes rival, beaten this year on the last lap of the last race, did not attend the event at the Louvre museum in Paris.
""It's my life goal achieved, so it sounds pretty decent,"" said Verstappen after being welcomed on stage as champion.
""Everything that comes next is just a bonus. I'm of course going to keep pushing, I'm going to be in F1 for a few more years but this has been an incredibly tough season,"" added the 24-year-old.
""It's been an incredible battle with Lewis, one of the greatest drivers ever in Formula One. I think we really pushed each other to the limit, sometimes over the limit ... I think in the end we really respect each other.
""I can't wait for next year to come back and for sure we're going to try again.""
Speaking to reporters earlier, Verstappen recognised his Mercedes rival's suffering.
Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff, who was also absent, had indicated some uncertainty over his disillusioned driver's future after last Sunday's finale in Abu Dhabi.
""I don't feel sorry but I can understand of course that it can be very painful,"" said Verstappen.
""But at the end of the day that's racing as well. You have to just keep fighting to the end and you know that in racing anything can happen.
""He also won a championship like that. So I think he can understand as well,"" added the 24-year-old, who overtook Hamilton nL1N2SX080 at Yas Marina when a sudden change to the safety car procedure gave him a chance after it seemed he had none.
Hamilton took his first title with McLaren in 2008 with a last corner move that shattered Brazilian Ferrari driver Felipe Massa's hopes.
Asked how bad it would be if Hamilton did not come back to renew the battle next season, Verstappen doubted that would happen.
""I can understand that the first few days after a race like that you're not happy but you should also understand this is racing,"" he said. ""I think he should just look back at what he has achieved already.
""That should give him a lot of comfort and should also be that drive to just keep on going because he is still trying to challenge for that eighth title and for sure he can do that again next year.

He replaces 75-year-old Frenchman Jean Todt, who is retiring after three terms of office.
The 60-year-old Dubai-born former rally driver was standing against British lawyer Graham Stoker, who has been Todt's deputy president for sport since 2009.
The FIA is the governing body for Formula 1, the World Rally Championship, World Endurance and Formula E among other series.
""The votes are in and we’ve won. We are thrilled that 62 per cent of all clubs have given us their vote,"" said Ben Sulayem's FIA for Members campaign on Twitter. An FIA spokesman confirmed the result.
Formula 1 will be high on Ben Sulayem's list of immediate sporting priorities after last Sunday's season-ending race in Abu Dhabi ended in uproar after a change to the safety car procedure led to Red Bull's Max Verstappen taking the title.
FIA race director Michael Masi has been at the centre of the controversy, with Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff saying that the Australian had ""robbed"" his driver Lewis Hamilton of a record eighth championship.
The governing body has agreed to look into the decision-making process and clarification of the rules.
Ben Sulayem, previously an FIA vice-president and World Motor Sport Council member, has Brazilian Fabiana Ecclestone, the wife of former Formula 1 supremo Bernie, on his team. She will be vice-president for sport in South America.

UEFA and CONMEBOL have fiercely opposed world soccer body FIFA's plans for a biennial World Cup, with the two this week signing an extended Memorandum of Understanding until June 2028.
European champions Italy are already also set to take on Daft question: Do I deserve a byline for this? Copa America winners Argentina in the so-called ""Finalissima"" on June 1 next year in London.
""UEFA is working on a number of projects with CONMEBOL, including a joint Nations League but nothing is finalised and no decisions have yet been made,"" a spokesperson told Reuters. 
In an interview with Polish outlet Meczyki on Thursday, UEFA vice-president Zbigniew Boniek said the 10 South American teams will be added to the Nations League competition from 2024. 
""From 2024 CONMEBOL will join the Nations League. We do not know yet in what formula, in what form ... we signed a memorandum about cooperation between CONMEBOL and UEFA and from 2024 these teams will play in the Nations League,"" he said. 
Boniek added that six CONMEBOL teams will join League A of the Nations League while the other four will join League B. 
The entry of South American sides would increase the number of teams in the two groups from 16 to 22 and 20, respectively, with all the matches reportedly set to be played in Europe to avoid excessive travel.
The revamped Nations League would also represent direct competition to FIFA's plans for a World Cup every two years, a proposal Boniek said would be difficult to implement, adding that he was against the idea of introducing more new events. 
FIFA will hold a global summit on Monday to discuss their ambitious plans, but UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin, who has been a vocal critic of the biennial World Cup idea, has said the meeting would not be a defining moment in the process.
""As much as we know FIFA is still pursuing the project, there are some signals coming from different sides that they might not pursue it till the end,"" he said this week. 
""We don't have a particular strategy. For Monday, it will be 211 federations, that means 500 people at the videoconference. I don't expect something very deep.""

The 60-year-old Emirati is the first non-European to serve as president of the International Automobile Federation, the governing body for a host of series including Formula One, rallying, endurance racing and electric Formula E.
His appointment comes in a year that has seen Saudi Arabia and Qatar added to the Formula One calendar on long-term contracts.
The region now has four races, with Abu Dhabi and Bahrain well-established on the schedule since 2004 and 2009 respectively.
Saudi Arabia also has the gruelling Dakar Rally, Formula E and Extreme E while Bahrain also hosts a round of the world endurance championship and Qatar has MotoGP.
British supercar makers McLaren are majority owned by  Bahrain's sovereign investment fund Mumtalakat, with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) also providing significant funding.
State-owned energy giant Saudi Aramco is a global partner of Formula One.
""No-one now can come near the Gulf or the Middle East and ignore motorsport,"" Ben Sulayem told reporters in Paris on Friday.
""It will be a help for the FIA to grow but it doesn't mean we forget the other regions.""
Ben Sulayem said improving diversity was high on his agenda along with increasing participation in motorsport.
He has said he wants to double the number taking part worldwide in the next four years, with much of that growth in the developing world.
He compared a country like Finland's success in Formula One and rallying to the huge and untapped potential of India and China as well as the Middle East.
The Emirati, who served as president of the UAE motorsport federation, said he would be moving to Paris to devote himself full-time to the position and had given up his other jobs.
He recalled how attitudes had changed in his region since he first began competing.
""I had to change my last name at the beginning because motorsport was not acceptable,"" said the winner of 14 Middle East rally championships.
""When I started winning they saw my photos and then they accepted it,"" he said.

Head coach Jim Harbaugh praised backup Tyler Huntler's performance as the understudy narrowly missed leading Baltimore's upset of the Green Bay Packers in Week 15.
Green Bay escaped with a 31-30 victory despite Huntley's four touchdowns - two passing, two rushing - plus 288 total yards (73 rushing).
The Ravens enter the week with a three-game losing streak and have been gutted by injuries.
Harbaugh said he remains optimistic Jackson can practice Wednesday and play in the AFC North rivalry game.
""We'll see how the ankle responds. It is getting better,"" Harbaugh said of Jackson.
Jackson did not practice last week and Huntley brought a spark to the offense that had been missing for more than a month, Harbaugh noted.
Determining whether Jackson is fully healthy - and thereby a better option behind center than Huntley - is a question with many variables.
""It's a good question but it's hard to answer because there's no definitive formula,"" Harbaugh said. ""We're going to have to see where we're at with all factors. You take everything into account and see what you feel best about going forward. Practice time, health wise, all those things. That's really all you can do.""
The Bengals and Ravens are 8-6 with Cincinnati in first place by virtue of the Bengals' head-to-head 41-17 win in Week 7 at Baltimore.
Both teams face playoff-bound opponents in Week 17. The Bengals host the Kansas City Chiefs and the Ravens face the Los Angeles Rams.

The Williams driver brought out the safety car late in the race, with a change in procedure giving Verstappen the opportunity to pass Mercedes' Hamilton on the last lap.
Before the crash, Hamilton had been heading for a record eighth title.
Latifi said in a statement on his website that he had decided to address the issue of abuse after staying off social media to let things settle down.
He said he hoped to spark another conversation about the ""drastic consequences"" of online bullying.
""I’ve received thousands of messages to my social media accounts...most have been supportive, but there’s been a lot of hate and abuse, too,"" said the 26-year-old.
""As we’ve seen time and time again, across all different sports, it only takes one incident at the wrong time to have things completely blown out of proportion and bring out the worst in people who are so-called 'fans' of the sport.
""What shocked me was the extreme tone of the hate, abuse, and even the death threats I received.""
Latifi said that he had apologised to his team for the crash and that the rest was out of his control. He said that he was no stranger to negative comments about his performances and that having a thick skin was part of being an athlete.
""But many of the comments I received last week crossed the line into something far more extreme. It concerns me how somebody else might react if this same level of abuse was ever directed at them,"" he added.
Latifi's situation was similar to that of German Timo Glock in 2008, when the Toyota driver received death threats after being passed by Hamilton on the last corner of the last lap of the final race in Brazil.
Hamilton won that title, his first, with Ferrari's Felipe Massa losing out.

Team boss Mattia Binotto told reporters that the 22-year-old German would be available to stand in at 11 of the record 23 scheduled races should Charles Leclerc or Carlos Sainz be unavailable.
Italian Antonio Giovinazzi, who lost his place at Swiss-based Alfa Romeo this year but has secured a drive in Formula E, will be reserve for the 12 races that do not clash with the electric series.
""Whenever he (Giovinazzi) will be at the race track he will be our reserve driver. And as well he will be available to our customer teams, so both Haas and Alfa Romeo,"" said Binotto.
""For the remaining 11 races... Mick Schumacher will be reserve driver for Ferrari.""
Haas have their own official reserve in Brazilian Pietro Fittipaldi, who stepped in twice in 2020 after Romain Grosjean's fiery accident. Alfa Romeo also have Poland's Robert Kubica in the role.
Ferrari-backed Schumacher made his Formula One debut this season, outperforming fellow-rookie Nikita Mazepin but neither scoring a point for a tail-end team devoting all their resources to the 2022 car.
Binotto said Mick had improved through the season, in consistency and speed, and Ferrari's support would continue with the simulator available at Maranello and Ferrari engineers working with him.
""If I look at the last races he was a lot closer to the cars ahead while Haas didn’t really develop the car at all,"" said the Ferrari boss.
Binotto said Giovinazzi would have a full programme of simulator work and suggested the Italian had a chance of returning to the starting grid full time in 2023.
""There are I think 11 seats which will be free in 2023 ... 11 have contracts finishing at the end of 2022. So it is important for him as a driver to still be part of our F1 programme,"" he said.
Binotto said talks would start soon on a contract extension with Spaniard Sainz, who had a strong season with Ferrari after moving from McLaren, and he expected the discussion to be uncomplicated. Leclerc has a long-term contract.
The as-yet unnamed 2022 Ferrari car was going to plan and due to be launched between Feb 16-18.
Ferrari finished third overall in 2021, a big jump from sixth the previous season, and Binotto said the team were stronger than before.
They are currently without a title sponsor but Binotto said talks were continuing with long-time partner Philip Morris International (PMI).
""I think there are many opportunities on which we may cooperate with them, keeping them as partners. We have various options on the table at the moment and we are still talking with them,"" he said.

India’s fourth choice bowler destroyed the home team’s top order as he took five wickets before tea and then finished with figures of 7-61 in 17.5 overs for the best bowling performance by an Indian in a test in South Africa.
“There was some help in the pitch, so all you had to do was keep coming hard at the batsman, bowl in the right spots,” he explained to a virtual news conference after the close of play.
“The ball was kicking in and it was staying low a bit, so all I did was to try to hit my lengths.”
“It was my best figures, but I always say the best is yet to come,” he added.
Thakur’s performance took much of the pressure off the rest of the Indian bowling attack, with Mohammed Siraj struggling after suffering a hamstring strain on the first day on Monday.
It was only the sixth test for the 30-year-old, who had played back-up to the formidable attack of Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami and Siraj but burst out of their shadow on Tuesday.
“In overseas conditions, all four seamers have an important role to play and it’s good that we were able to do it in a partnership.”

Silverstone-based Aston Martin, owned by Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll, said in a statement that a leadership team would take over until a replacement was appointed.
There was no immediate comment from Alpine.
""We would like to thank him for the service provided to the team over the past 12 years and wish him well for the future as he will undoubtedly take on new challenges,"" Mercedes-powered Aston Martin said.
""Fortunately, we are led and managed by a strong group of individuals, and we are comfortable to take a little time to explore options before announcing a new team structure.
""The focus of the team is currently on preparing the most competitive car possible for the start of the 2022 season.""
The season is due to start in Bahrain on March 20.
Szafnauer's departure came as no real surprise, his position subject to considerable speculation last year.
French publication AutoHebdo reported in November that Szafnauer, a long-time Formula One insider who worked with Honda and then Force India owner Vijay Mallya before that team was taken over by Stroll, had been approached by Alpine.
The Romanian-American executive failed to silence the rumour-mill, despite saying he had a long-term contract with Aston Martin and no intention of leaving.
""I love this team... I've been loyal to this team. I've had many, many offers in the 12 years that I've been working for this team, especially in the days of (Force India) bankruptcy and insolvency,"" he said then.
""I could have left many times, but I'm loyal to the employees there.""
Aston Martin last year brought in former McLaren team boss Martin Whitmarsh as group chief executive, a position above Szafnauer.
Stroll has been investing heavily in the team, recruiting from rivals and expanding the factory as he seeks to turn Aston Martin into title challengers.
His son Lance is one of the drivers, along with four times world champion Sebastian Vettel.

The Mercedes driver was less than a lap away from a record eighth title in Abu Dhabi nL1N2SX080 on Dec. 12 when he was passed by Red Bull rival Max Verstappen after race director Michael Masi changed the safety car procedure.
Hamilton spoke briefly before the podium, then sought out Dutchman Verstappen to congratulate him but has otherwise said nothing publicly.
""We are still in the pandemic and I just really wish to stay safe and have a good Christmas ... and we will see about next year,"" he said in Abu Dhabi.
Hamilton did not speak to the media after being knighted nL1N2T012J at Windsor Castle on Dec. 15 and failed to show for the governing FIA's prize-giving nL1N2T20VN in Paris a day later, risking punishment since turning up is mandatory for the top three in the championship.
Formula One's most successful driver, with 103 career wins, has posted nothing on social media since before the race at Yas Marina. 
He now follows nobody on Instagram, where he has 26.5 million followers, but it is not the first time he has started afresh.
At the end of 2017 Hamilton, or his media team, also wiped his Instagram and Twitter accounts after critics condemned comments he made over Christmas about his young nephew wearing a pink dress.
MEDIA BREAK
""I think he’s just having a bit of a social media break. I don’t blame him, social media can be a very toxic place but he’s cool though. He’s fine,"" his brother Nicolas said on streaming platform Twitch late last month.
Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff described Hamilton on Dec. 16 as disillusioned but said he was in regular contact with the driver, who is signed to the end of 2023.
""I would very much hope Lewis continues racing because he is the greatest driver of all time,"" added the Austrian. ""As a racer his heart will say I need to continue because he's at the peak of his game.
""But we have to overcome the pain nL1N2T111T that was caused upon him on Sunday. He is a man with clear values.""
Mercedes posted on Twitter a picture of Hamilton on Jan 2 with the caption ""Adversity causes some to break; others to break records."" 
The team clearly expect Hamilton to race on, with a new team mate in compatriot George Russell, but will want to see concrete steps from the FIA to address what happened in Abu Dhabi.
The future of Masi, an Australian and also silent since the end of the season, is key. 
Mohammed Ben Sulayem, new president of the governing FIA, told reporters last week he was confident Hamilton would be back but had not spoken to him.
""I don’t think he’s 100per cent ready to respond right now. We don’t blame him,"" the Emirati said at the Dakar Rally in Saudi Arabia.

The 24-year-old Dutch driver will be up against some top names from the world of motor racing and esports in the Jan. 15-16 event.
Spain's reigning IndyCar champion Alex Palou is in the field along with double Indianapolis 500 winner and former F1 racer Juan Pablo Montoya, Dutch two-times F1 esports champion Jarno Opmeer and an all-female W Series team.
Double Formula One world champion and two-times Le Mans winner Fernando Alonso is non-driving captain of the Alpine esports team.
Red Bull's Verstappen, who won the F1 title with a controversial last lap overtake of Mercedes' seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton, entered the virtual endurance race in 2020 with McLaren's Lando Norris.
They were leading for Team Redline when a frozen screen led to a collision with eventual winners Rebellion-Williams Esports. Verstappen's pro team mate this time is Swedish IndyCar driver Felix Rosenqvist.
The virtual Le Mans 24 Hours is broadcast live on YouTube, Twitch and Facebook and uses the rFactor2 platform, with racers competing on simulators around the world for a US$125,000 winners' prize.
The five-race Le Mans Virtual series has an overall prize pool of US$250,000.
The inaugural 2020 version, created to fill a gap after the real 24 Hours was postponed and held behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was watched by more than 14 million viewers.
The virtual 2022 edition had been scheduled as a live event to be held at the Autosport International Show in Birmingham, England, but that was postponed due to the continuing pandemic.

Members of Italian-American team PoliMOVE cheered as their Formula 1 racecar, nicknamed ""Minerva"", repeatedly passed a rival entered by South Korean team Kaist.
Minerva was doing nearly 185kph when it blew past the Kaist car, easily beating the top speed hoped for by race organizers.
But every racer was deemed a winner by organisers who saw the real victory as the fact that self-driving algorithms could handle the high-speed competition.
""It's a success,"" Indy Autonomous Challenge (IAC) co-organizer Paul Mitchell said to AFP before the checkered flag was waved.
The race pitted teams of students from around the world against one another to rev up the capabilities of self-driving cars, improving the technology for use anywhere.
In October, the IAC put the brakes on self-driving F1 cars racing together to allow more time to ready technology for the challenge, opting instead to let them do laps individually to see which had the best time.
""This almost holds the world record for speed of an autonomous car,"" PoliMOVE engineer Davide Rigamonti boasted as he gazed lovingly at the white-and-black beauty.
The single seat usually reserved for a driver was during this race instead packed with electronics.
PoliMOVE had a shot at victory at another race in October in Indianapolis, clocking about 250kph before skidding out on a curve, according to Rigamonti.
Friday, it was the South Korean entry that spun out after overtaking a car fielded by a team from the University of Auburn in the southern US state of Alabama.
""The students who program these cars are not mechanics; most of them knew nothing about racing,"" said IndyCar specialist Lee Anne Patterson.
""We taught them about racing.""
The students program the software that pilots the car by quickly analyzing data from sophisticated sensors.
The software piloting the cars has to anticipate how other vehicles on the course will behave, then maneuver accordingly, according to Markus Lienkamp, a professor at Munich, TUM, which won the October competition.
Nearby, Lienkamp's students are glued to screens.
""It plays out in milliseconds,"" said Mitchell.
""The computer has to make the same decisions as a human driver, despite the speed.""
The IAC plans to organize other races on the model of Friday's - pitting two cars against each other, with the hope of reaching a level sufficient to one day launch all the vehicles together.","['352_0', '352_1', '352_2']","['\n      The cars are packed with electronic sensors where the driver would normally be.

Chief executive Davide Grasso hailed a ""back to the future"" first step for a 107-year-old company famed for fast luxury cars and keen to re-establish its sporting credentials.
The Modena-based marque is part of Stellantis, formed last year by the merger of Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA, and has already announced that all its models will have electric versions by 2025.
Grasso told reporters Maserati had been working for a year with Formula E on plans for a return to the racetrack for the first time since 2010 when it competed in the GT1 sportscar championship.
Formula E chairman Alejandro Agag said the announcement was ""probably one of the greatest days in the history of the championship.
""To have a brand as iconic as Maserati, with the racing heritage... come into the electric revolution that we are pushing is really an incredible moment for Formula E.""
The FIA-sanctioned city-based series will be starting its ninth season next year with a third generation (Gen3) car billed as the world's most efficient and capable of reaching speeds of 320kph.
Nissan, Jaguar, Porsche, Mahindra, Stellantis-owned DS and China's Nio are the manufacturers so far signed up for 2023, when a US$13 million cost cap will be in place. McLaren also have an option.
Grasso promised details soon on how Maserati would participate.
""Formula E will be our technological laboratory to accelerate the development of high-efficiency electrified powertrains and intelligent software for our road sports cars,"" said Stellantis' motorsport head Jean-Marc Finot.
Grasso said racing was key to the rebuilding of Maserati, and other steps would follow.
An eventual return to Formula One, where Stellantis is active with the Sauber-operated Alfa Romeo team, was not excluded.
Formula E lost BMW and Audi last season, and Mercedes will be leaving at the end of this year, but Agag said it remained as relevant as ever to manufacturers.
""It's great to have an Italian team,"" he added. ""It's taken a few years but I think it couldn't be a better brand than Maserati.
""We have already a great race in Rome and a great partner on the broadcasting side with Mediaset and Sky but now we have an Italian team.""

Montoya, winner at the Brickyard in 2000 and 2015, drove for Arrow McLaren at last year's Indy 500, finishing ninth.
""Juan Pablo is an institution in motorsport, with two Indianapolis 500 victories and an impressive Formula 1 career with multiple wins for McLaren,"" said McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown in a statement.

The 23-year-old told a news conference in Istanbul on Wednesday that he had signed a deal with Czech-based Charouz Racing System and had the ultimate goal of one day racing in Formula One.
Bolukbasi started out on virtual racetracks with the F1 esports series, making his debut in 2017 and continuing for three seasons.
He also won the 2020 Formula Renault Esport Series and finished runner-up on the real racetrack in the GT4 European Series the same year.
""If I was never in F1 Esports, I would never have had the chance to get into a real car. I would not be where I am now,"" said Bolukbasi. 
""I think it's also very important to be the first gamer to do this, because it can give people hope. If people see that one person can do it, they will believe they can do it as well.
""If I can go from F1 Esports to Formula Two, I think anyone can.""
The Turk raced in Formula Three in 2021, scoring points in 13 of his 15 races. He tested an F2 car after the end of last  season in Abu Dhabi.
Bolukbasi has been backed by several big Turkish companies and state agencies, as well as Turkey's Motor Sports Federation (TOSFED).
The last Turkish driver to compete at F2 level was Jason Tahincioglu, son of former TOSFED president Mumtaz, who raced in what was then GP2 in 2006 and 2007 without scoring a point.

The International Automobile Federation (FIA) promised in December ""a detailed analysis and clarification exercise"" of a controversy it recognised was tarnishing the image of the championship.
It has said it will discuss what happened with all teams and drivers and reach a conclusion before the start of the season in March.
An FIA spokesman said on Wednesday the investigation was being led by Peter Bayer, the Geneva-based secretary general for motorsport, and would be 'thorough, objective and transparent'.
The process started after the last meeting of the World Motor Sport Council on Dec 15, two days before Emirati Mohammed Ben Sulayem was elected FIA president, and has become more active in the past week.
Formula One race director Michael Masi, the FIA official at the centre of the storm, sparked uproar after a late change in the safety car procedure handed an advantage to Red Bull's Max Verstappen.
Verstappen was then able to pass Hamilton on the last lap to win the race and his first title, denying the Mercedes driver a record eighth.
Mercedes, who felt Hamilton was robbed, dropped the threat of an appeal after the FIA probe was announced but warned they would hold the governing body to account and needed to see actions as well as words.
Some see Masi's position as untenable but there is also no clear replacement for the Australian.
Hamilton has a contract to the end of 2023 but there has been plenty of speculation in the media that he could call it a day if the FIA does not come up with an adequate response.
The Briton, who turned 37 this month, has shunned social media and avoided making any public comment since the Dec. 12 race.
He said over the team radio during the race that ""this has been manipulated"".
The next World Motor Sport Council meeting is due to be held in Paris on Feb 3 but any report must first go to the Formula One commission and sporting advisory committee for consideration.

The 2021 title was won by Red Bull's Max Verstappen after a change to the usual safety car procedure allowed him to overtake Lewis Hamilton on the last lap and denied the Mercedes driver a record eighth title.
The FIA recognised last month that the uproar was tarnishing the image of the championship and said it would carry out a thorough analysis with all teams and drivers to be consulted.
There has been criticism on social media of the apparent slow pace of the investigation, with suggestions that Hamilton's future in the sport could depend on the outcome.
The Briton has been silent since Abu Dhabi, making no comment on events.
The FIA, also largely silent on the process in recent weeks, issued a timetable on Thursday and said the Sporting Advisory Committee would meet on Jan. 19 and look at the use of the safety car.
""The following stage will be a shared discussion with all F1 drivers,"" it said.
""The outcome of the detailed analysis will be presented to the F1 Commission in February and final decisions will be announced at the World Motor Sport Council in Bahrain on 18 March.""
It said newly-elected FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem had asked Peter Bayer, the secretary general for sport, for ""proposals to review and optimise the organisation of the FIA F1 structure for the 2022 season.""
Mercedes would not comment on a report in the Daily Mail newspaper that team boss Toto Wolff would be meeting Ben Sulayem, a former rally driver, on Friday.
Much of the discussion could be about the future of race director Michael Masi, the Australian at the centre of the controversy.
Wolff said last month that Mercedes would be holding the FIA to account and needed action as well as words.

Krack worked previously in Formula One with Swiss-based Sauber.
The move means he will work again with four times world champion Sebastian Vettel, who made his Formula One debut with BMW-Sauber in 2007 and races for Aston Martin along with Canadian Lance Stroll.
""I have been working in motorsport for over 20 years, and worked in Formula One with Seb Vettel in 2006 and 2007 when I was a BMW-Sauber engineer and he was the team’s test driver,"" said Krack.
""I have huge respect for his speed and ability, and it will be fantastic to be reunited with him.
""Lance Stroll is a seriously fast and talented driver, too, with 100 Grands Prix starts to his name, and I am very much looking forward to working closely with him.""
Mercedes-powered Aston Martin, owned by Stroll's billionaire father Lawrence, finished seventh last season but have big ambitions and are building a new factory while also hiring some top names from other teams.
""Winning in Formula One is all about bringing together the best efforts of all the principal players - drivers, engineers, mechanics, everyone - and Mike is perfectly placed to do just that,"" said Stroll. 
Szafnauer, who had been with the team since the days when they raced as Force India under the ownership of Vijay Mallya, departed this month with media speculation linking him to  Renault-owned rivals Alpine.
Former McLaren team boss Martin Whitmarsh, who is now the Aston Martin team's group chief executive, said Krack would report to him and Stroll.
""Having worked in very senior motorsport positions at both BMW and Porsche, backed by an engineering background in Formula One with Sauber, Mike possesses a blend of experience and expertise that makes him the ideal choice for us,"" he said.
""He works well with drivers, having prioritised that aspect of his role at BMW in recent years, and also with engineers, since he speaks their language.""

In a piece on the year ahead on the McLaren website, Brown said some rivals were seeking ""excuses to raise the cost cap and win world championships with chequebooks"" while also gaining an advantage with B teams.
Without naming names, the American said ""at times it has seemed the sport is governed by certain teams"" and more leadership was needed from Liberty Media-owned Formula One and the governing FIA.
The FIA last month elected a new president, Emirati Mohammed Ben Sulayem, in place of Frenchman Jean Todt, while Italian Stefano Domenicali took over last year as Formula One chief executive.
The 2021 season ended in uproar, with Mercedes accusing race director Michael Masi of robbing Lewis Hamilton of an eighth crown with a late change to the safety car procedure that favoured Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who took the title.
Both Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff and Red Bull's Christian Horner spoke on the radio to Masi during the race and the Australian official's future remains uncertain, with some maintaining that his position has become untenable.
Brown said the past had been characterised by ""a mainly autocratic style of governance"", a reference to decades under former supremo Bernie Ecclestone, and a more consultative approach had been necessary to reset the sport.
""Moving forward there is a need to shift back to stronger, more directive leadership and governance at the top of the sport,"" said the American.
""It is clear that some of the rules and their governance are not acceptable as things stand.""
Brown said the teams had contributed to inconsistencies in policing the regulations and had voted for many of the rules they now complained about.
He suggested the events of Abu Dhabi, subject to investigation by the governing body, resulted from systemic failures with ""a seeming lack of preparation for the events unfolding and temporary inertia on the solutions.""
""It is the teams who applied the pressure to avoid finishing races under a safety car at all costs,"" he observed.
""It is the teams who have been using the broadcasting of radio messages to the race director to try to influence penalties and race outcomes, to the point where an over-excited team principal plays to the gallery and pressurises race officials.

""The Red Arrows, officially known as the Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team, are not classed as military aviation and, as such, do not fall into the category of those displays that will no longer be permitted at Formula One events.""
Italy's Corriere della Sera reported that the country's Frecce Tricolori would no longer feature at Imola and Monza this year, however.
The paper said some suspected Formula One wanted to remove displays that might be seen as shows of military power or propaganda.
Several races have regularly featured flypasts by fighter jets and commercial airliners.
Races in Abu Dhabi and Bahrain are sponsored by airlines Etihad and Gulf Air respectively with both using their Boeing 787 Dreamliners to highlight low-emission technology and sustainable fuel.
The Austrian Grand Prix at the Red Bull Ring has also featured historic plans owned by the energy drink company's  billionaire owner Dietrich Mateschitz.
Formula One is aiming to achieve a net zero-carbon footprint by 2030, with 100per cent sustainable fuels from 2026 when a new engine is introduced.
Nearly all cars were banned from September's Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort, with most fans either cycling to the coastal circuit west of Amsterdam or taking the train.

Although there are no Formula 1-grade tracks in Colombia, city officials said the economic attractions were tempting.
“It would duplicate the number of tourists that come here – and over just three days. We are daring to dream,” said Barranquilla mayor Jaime Pumarejo.
The country’s president Ivan Duque told an audience in Barranquilla on Saturday they had presented their proposals to Liberty Media and said: “Count on us.”
The idea involves building ""a semi-urban"" venue, Duque said.
Further details about the bid were not disclosed.
There are a record 23 races scheduled this year and although organisers are keen to expand the sport’s geographical reach, they have looked primarily at adding venues in Africa and the United States.
Formula 1 currently has Latin American races in Mexico and Brazil.

This is the fourth contract renewal for Singapore, and the seven-year extension is the longest for the race to date, said the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) and race organiser Singapore GP on Thursday (Jan 27).
""We have decided to continue hosting the F1 race for another seven years, after thoroughly evaluating the long term benefits that a term extension could bring to Singapore,"" said Transport Minister and Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations S Iswaran. 
""The renewal will help sustain Singapore’s reputation as a global city with a vibrant lifestyle, attracting international visitors as travel rebounds, and generating business revenue and jobs for Singaporeans,"" he added.
""We will ensure that this year’s and future races, as large scale international sporting events, are COVID-safe, informed by the prevailing pandemic situation and public health assessment.""
The Singapore Grand Prix night race was cancelled in 2020 and 2021 after it was scheduled as part of the Formula 1 race calendar. 
Mr Colin Syn, deputy chairman of Singapore GP, had said last year that the 2021 race cancellation was made “in light of the prevailing restrictions for live events in Singapore”, while taking into consideration the health and safety of fans, contractors, volunteers and staff members. 
In November last year, Mr Iswaran said during a press conference that discussions were ongoing on a contract for a new term of the race in Singapore.
“I think we all recognise that events, such as the Formula 1, generate significant economic benefits and global branding value for Singapore. They invigorate Singapore's events calendar, they build our international demand and also support job creation of businesses,"" he said then.

The series begins in Miami from May 6-8 as a support event for the inaugural Formula One Miami Grand Prix around the Hard Rock Stadium.
It will also race for the first time at Spain's Circuit de Catalunya, French Grand Prix venue Paul Ricard at Le Castellet, and make its Asian debut at Japan's Suzuka.
Mexico's Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, another new venue on the calendar, will host the season finale on Oct. 28-30.
Britain's Silverstone, Hungarian Grand Prix host Hungaroring and the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas, which featured on last year's schedule, will return in 2022.
The Texas race, however, remains subject to contract.
The series put on eight races at six circuits last year, with Austin the only non-European venue.
""We have always stated our intention to make the series a truly global movement and this calendar is the next step towards achieving that,"" said W Series Chief Executive Catherine Bond Muir in a statement.
""Last year, we began a landmark partnership with Formula One and our talented grid of female racing drivers proved that they belong on motor racing’s greatest stage.""
The W Series, which uses identical cars homologated to FIA Formula Three specifications, was launched in 2019 to help women climb the motorsport ladder to Formula One, which has not had a female race driver since Italian Lella Lombardi in 1976.
Inaugural W Series champion Briton Jamie Chadwick successfully defended her title last year, with the series not racing in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

    ""Firstly, there are going to be one or two slight changes to the track,"" Saudi Motorsport Company Chief Executive Martin Whitaker said in a statement.
    ""These tweaks are directly related to a drivers’ sightline from the cockpit.
    ""It’s minimal work, but it will help improve forward visibility in a couple of corners.""
    The 6.1-km long Jeddah Corniche Circuit made its Formula One debut in December and is considered to be the second-fastest track on the calendar after Monza in Italy.
Its flowing layout of mainly flat-out blasts along the city's Red Sea waterfront and a succession of high speed corners hemmed in by walls, made it difficult for drivers to spot slower moving cars around some turns.
    That led to some near misses in practice and qualifying, before the track produced a dramatic race on Sunday that was halted twice due to crashes.
    Drivers enjoyed tearing around the high-speed layout but raised concerns about the lack of visibility around corners.
    ""The length of time between the two races has enabled us to reflect on some aspects that did and didn’t work,"" said Whitaker, adding that some barriers around the track would also be modified to accommodate the racing lines drivers were taking through certain corners.
    ""And we have been striving to improve on some areas for our second event.""

The mandate, which was first reported by the Times newspaper and the BBC, will apply to anyone entering the paddock - an exclusive area in which teams and drivers set up shop for a race weekend.
""F1 will require all travelling personnel to be fully vaxxed and will not request exemptions,"" the spokesperson said.
This will include all competitors, hospitality staff, members of the media, the governing FIA, Liberty Media-owned commercial rights holders FOM and even celebrity guests.
The mandate was approved at a December meeting of the FIA's World Motor Sport Council.
News of F1's vaccine mandate comes after Novak Djokovic's Australian Open vaccine controversy.
The world number one was detained by immigration authorities on Jan 6, ordered released by a court on Jan 10, then detained again before being forced to leave Australia after a final court ruling that upheld the government's decision to cancel his visa.
The new rules call into question the future of long-time medical car driver Alan van der Merwe.
The South African, who played a pivotal role rescuing Romain Grosjean from a fiery crash in the 2020 Bahrain Grand Prix, has chosen not to get vaccinated for personal reasons. The FIA did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the vaccine mandate or Van der Merwe's future.

""We are the first but won't be the only one,” Spanish soccer league executive director Oscar Mayo told Reuters in an interview. 
“Many leagues are calling us to ask if we can help them on how to structure their deal."" 
Speaking ahead of Tuesday’s launch of the partnership, the first of its kind in soccer with a private equity fund, Mayo added: ""France is in the verge of doing so and already have the support of their government, Portugal and Italy are also close. It won't take long to see similar deals being signed.”
Reuters reported in December that buyout funds including CVC and Bain Capital were lining up preliminary bids for a stake worth some 1.5 billion euros in the French league media rights business.
Beyond a much-needed cash injection, Ligue 1 hopes that private equity firms could help make French soccer more attractive, and double or treble revenues in five to 10 years.    
""The industry have matured enough now to have the credibility to do this type of partnership,"" Mayo said.
""Ten years ago the clubs were losing money, lots of players were suffering with unpaid salaries, we had a debt of more than 300 million euros with the government. The industry was not ready, it was difficult even to get financial help from banks. We needed to create stability and structure through the Financial Fair Play so we could inspire trust to investors.""
The 1.99 billion euro investment will secure CVC an 8.2per cent stake in a new company that will manage revenues from LaLiga's broadcasting and sponsorship rights for 50 years.
LaLiga expects the total value of its business to increase from 24.2 to 33-35 billion euros in between seven to 10 years, and it will also help the clubs to invest their share of the money the right way.
The clubs will have to allocate 70per cent of funds for infrastructure and modernisation projects. Up to 15per cent can be used to sign players, with the remaining 15per cent for reducing debt. Each club will present their projects to LaLiga before June and it will have to be approved.
""We want to build in four years what would have taken 20 years to do in normal circumstances. We'll grow faster than other leagues and close the gap to the English Premier League,"" Mayo said, explaining that first installment of 400 million euros was delivered in January and in July CVC will have paid the first 1 billion euros. 
The other 1 billion will be paid in installments over the next two years.
""The clubs will be modernised, the fan experience will be better and our value will grow. The other European leagues are aware of that and will follow our path,"" Mayo said.
CVC has invested in Formula 1, Moto GP, rugby and tennis and it is the third time the private equity fund has tried to invest in a top European league, after separate plans with Italy's Serie A and Germany's Bundesliga were scrapped last year.
Real Madrid, Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao are taking legal action against LaLiga over the deal. The three clubs opted out from the deal, calling it ""an illegal transaction that causes irreparable damage"" to Spanish football.

Anton Dukach, the second on to the track in the opening training session for the men's singles, lay face down on the ice after hitting the side and coming off his sled.
For a moment there was tension in the air at the Yanqing National Sliding Centre with the Ukrainian motionless for several seconds which felt much, much longer.
""I was ok,"" said a matter of fact Dukach, after responding to his crash with a solid second run.
With competitors hurtling down the sharp turns of the icy track at speeds of over 130 kph, feet-first and face-up, the risks involved in luge are obvious.
At the Vancouver Olympics in 2010, Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili of Georgia tragically died after crashing in a practice run.
That was the first fatality in 35 years for the sport but despite the horror, on Wednesday the Georgian's cousin, Saba Kumaritashvili, made his Olympic debut in luge.
Also taking part in the training for Saturday's men's singles was Poland's Mateusz Sochowicz who needed surgery after fracturing his left kneecap and cutting his right leg to the bone in an accident at Yanqing in November last year.
Sochowicz hit a closed barrier that should have been open during a training session and said at the time that he may struggle to have faith in the Olympic course.
But on Wednesday, he was out there, racing with the best in the world.
Television struggles to do justice to the speed at which the athletes, in skin-tight suits and with little protection other than from their helmets, career around the course.
But those who are able to observe from close-up are left in no doubt about the raw speed generated as the luges fly past in a roaring blur.
Britain's German-born luger Rupert Staudinger said it is an exhilarating sport to compete in.
""I do enjoy it a lot. It is such a great sport, it is fast and so much fun. Hitting the G-forces, from one curve to another, it is like flying just different - I love it - it's like Formula One, I guess,"" he said.
Austria's Wolfgang Kindl was fastest in Group A with a time of 57.724 while Italy's Dominik Fischnaller posted a time of 57.810 in the Group B races.
The men's singles medals will be decided on Sunday with the fourth official run of the competition.

Fry, who joined the Renault-owned squad in February 2020 as their chassis technical director, will now oversee all technical activities at their headquarters.
The team also promoted former engineering director Matt Harman to technical director. 
He will be in charge of delivering performance upgrades to the track and will also drive closer collaboration between the team’s Enstone headquarters and their power unit factory in Viry-Chatillon near Paris.
“Pat is one of the most experienced engineers in Formula One, while Matt’s drive and expertise will prove critical in extracting the full potential of our race cars,"" said Alpine Chief Executive Laurent Rossi. 
Fry started out in Formula One with Benetton before joining McLaren in 1993, winning world championships with Mika Hakkinen and Lewis Hamilton, before joining Ferrari as deputy technical director in 2010. 
He returned to McLaren in 2018 for a stint as engineering director before making the switch to Alpine, which then raced as Renault.
Harman joined the Enstone team from dominant Mercedes in 2018. 
Formula One is set to embark on a new era in 2022 with new-look cars designed to radically overhauled rules.
Alpine, whose drivers are Spanish double-world champion Fernando Alonso and Frenchman Esteban Ocon, finished fifth in the overall standings last year after returning to the top step of the podium and are hoping to move up the field this season. 
They are expected to sign former Aston Martin team principal Otmar Szafnauer as their new team boss, having parted ways with Marcin Budkowski last month.

        The team finished last overall in 2021 with neither Schumacher, son of seven times world champion Michael, nor Russian team mate Mazepin scoring points in a car that was often adrift of the rest of the field.  
        But the squad, having forgone development on last year's challenger to focus on their 2022 car, are pinning their hopes on the sport's new rules giving them the break they need to make their way back into the points-scoring positions.   
        That would see Schumacher follow in the footsteps of his father Michael and uncle Ralf to become the third member of his family to score Formula One points.  
        ""We made the decision back in 2020 to really channel time and resources into the VF-22...,"" said team owner Gene Haas in a statement.   
        ""Hopefully that decision bears fruit and we return to challenging for points and taking something from the weekends.”  
        Haas, who made their debut in 2016, chalked up a best finish of fifth in the overall standings in 2018.  
The VF-22 has been designed to Formula One's radically new rules, with revised aerodynamics aimed at improving wheel-to-wheel racing and 18-inch wheels.
        It will continue to sport the Russian-themed livery it carried last year representing title sponsor Uralkali, which is owned by Mazepin's father.  
        “This is probably the most complex project the (team) has dealt with to-date for many reasons,"" said technical director Simone Resta.   
        ""It’s a completely new set of regulations and this season we’ve brought in a new team to manage the creation of the VF-22,"" he added.  
        Schumacher and Mazepin, both rookies last year, will be heading into their second Formula One season.  
        The German, who acquitted himself well against Mazepin in 2021, is part of Ferrari's driver development programme and will double up as the Italian team's reserve this year.   
        The VF-22 will hit the track for a pre-season session in Barcelona from Feb. 23-25 before the official pre-season test in Bahrain from March 10-12.

Formula One trialled the sprint-race format at three events last year, with qualifying brought forward a day to Friday and a 100 km race held on Saturday to decide the grid for Sunday's grand prix.
The sport had planned to roll out the format across six events this season.
""I don’t know exactly what is happening,"" Steiner said in a virtual press briefing on Friday, shortly after the U.S.-owned team unveiled a digital rendering of their 2022 car.
""We are having a Formula One Commission meeting in 10 days and then we will see more where we are with that one.
""I think we will have three sprint races but ... I don’t know that. So let’s see where we can get to, but I don’t have the answer yet.""
Formula One introduced a cost cap last season, limiting the amount of money teams can spend in a bid to create a more level playing field.
The cap, introduced at US$145 million in 2021, has been lowered to a base figure of US$140 million this year. 
Three of the sport's big teams want that cap raised to account for the increased number of sprint races in a season when they will also be getting to grips with cars designed to radically new rules.
McLaren boss Zak Brown accused teams lobbying to raise the cost cap of holding the sport hostage, in an open letter published on the team's website last month.
Formula One bosses are set to propose a compromise at a Formula One Commission meeting on Feb 14, keeping the cost cap intact but scaling back the number of sprint events to three, the same as last year.
The compromise will need at least 28 votes from 30 to pass, meaning the three teams asking for a cost-cap increase could prevent a deal from being reached.
Steiner, however, is hopeful that a compromise can be achieved.
""We have to lobby on the other side that it (cost-cap increase) doesn’t happen,"" said Steiner.
""There is a governance in place that will solve the problem out in my opinion.""",['330_0'],"['\nFILE PHOTO: Formula One F1 - Azerbaijan Grand Prix - Baku City Circuit, Baku, Azerbaijan - June 4, 2021 Haas F1 Team Principal Guenther Steiner during the press conference Pool\xa0via\xa0REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov\n']"

The Briton, who hadn't spoken publicly since a broadcast interview immediately after he lost the title in controversial circumstances to Red Bull rival Max Verstappen, put up a post on his Instagram account after a near two-month hiatus.
The 37-year-old Mercedes driver uploaded a photograph of himself at what appeared to be the Grand Canyon in the US with the caption; ""I've been gone. Now I'm back!""
Hamilton, winner of a record 103 races, had been on course to clinch an unprecedented eighth title with victory in last year's season-ending race at the Yas Marina track.
But an ad-hoc change to the safety car rules by race director Michael Masi in an attempt to create a last-lap showdown between the title rivals gave Verstappen, on fresher tyres, the opportunity to make the decisive pass.
Hamilton did not speak to the media after being knighted at Windsor Castle on Dec. 15 and failed to show for the governing FIA's prize-giving in Paris a day later, risking punishment since turning up is mandatory for the top three in the championship.
His silence also fuelled speculation surrounding his future, with Mercedes boss Toto Wolff on Dec. 16 describing Hamilton, who has a contract until the end of 2023, as ""disillusioned"".
The Briton has reportedly been waiting on the outcome of the governing FIA's investigation into the Abu Dhabi race, in particular Masi's role as race director, to make a decision on his future.
But the body last month said that decisions resulting from its analysis will only be announced at its World Motor Sport Council on Mar 18 in Bahrain, the day of Friday's practice session for the season-opening race in the Gulf island Kingdom.
Mercedes, who are set to launch their new car on Feb 18, have been posting Hamilton-themed content on their social media accounts.

Formula One launched its ""We Race As One"" diversity, inclusion and sustainability platform in 2020, which included a pre-race moment when drivers gathered on the grid to express their support for the initiative with a gesture of their choice.
""I think it was the time to move from just a gesture recognising something that’s really important to a plan,"" Domenicali said.
""I think the gesture has been an important gesture because we need to respect everyone as always. But now is the time to move on and take some other action.""
Some drivers, most notably seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton who is a vocal advocate for human rights, ending racial inequality and environmental causes, chose to take the knee.
Others remained standing while wearing T-shirts bearing messages in support of various causes.
They all appeared in a video broadcast just before the pre-race moment of support.
The video will still be broadcast this season, a Formula One spokesperson said, and ""We Race As One"" branding will feature around race tracks.
Domenicali's interview with Sky Sports took place as Formula One announced a four-year extension to its engineering scholarship programme for under-represented groups until 2025.
The programme, launched last year, has enabled 10 students to find placements for engineering degrees at universities in the United Kingdom and Italy. 
Domenicali sounded optimistic that Hamilton would carry on racing, after the Briton broke his near two-month long silence following his controversial Abu Dhabi world title defeat with a social media post on Friday.
""I saw the last picture was a light of positivity on his face and his gesture,"" said Domenicali. 
""I think that is important because Lewis is an incredible asset not only for our sport but for the world.
""Lewis has in front of him a possibility to be an eight-time world champion. I think his battery will be fully charged for the start of the season,"" he added.
The Formula One season begins on March 20 in Bahrain.

The 22-year-old, whose four podium finishes earned him sixth in the overall standings and secured fourth in the constructors' battle for McLaren in 2021, had been handed a multi-year contract extension last year. 
The new deal locks the Briton down at McLaren for the entirety of the current rules era, starting with this year's new-look cars, during which the Woking-based team hope to rekindle their former championship-challenging form. 
His team mate is Australian Daniel Ricciardo whose contract runs until the end of 2023.
""The opportunity to extend our relationship with Lando reflect not only our commitment but our belief and confidence in his talent,"" team principal Andreas Seidl said in a statement.
""It is also a strong sign of trust and commitment from Lando in us as a team and our journey to world championship contention.""
Norris made his Formula One debut with McLaren in 2019 after graduating from a test and reserve role.
Last season was his best yet, with the 22-year-old very nearly claiming a first win from a maiden pole position in Russia until a tyre gamble in changing conditions backfired and dropped him down the field. 
McLaren, despite slipping from third to fourth in the standings last season, took their first win since 2012 at the Italian Grand Prix with Ricciardo leading Norris across the line in a one-two.
The team, who are powered by Mercedes, are hoping to continue their climb back to the head of the field under Formula One's new rules which are designed to boost wheel-to-wheel racing and will extend through to the end of 2025 when a new power unit is set to be introduced.
""I have grown up in this team and I’m part of this journey we’re all on,"" said Norris.
""Last season was another great step, both in my career and the team’s performance, and I see and feel all the work, investment, and commitment for the team to be in a position to challenge for wins and titles in the future.""
McLaren are set to launch their 2022 car on Feb. 11 ahead of a record 23-race season which begins in Bahrain on March 20.

The new deal, announced to coincide with the launch of Red Bull's 2022 car on Wednesday with which Verstappen hopes to defend his title, will see the team renamed Oracle Red Bull Racing.
The Milton Keynes-based outfit will also make greater use of Oracle's cloud infrastructure to hone race strategy and engine development, including work on the team's new 2026 power units, and help Red Bull drive greater fan engagement.
It will involve applying artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to groom its junior drivers and the setting up of gaming partnership Oracle Red Bull Racing Esports, the team said in a statement.
Oracle's scaled up partnership with Red Bull further boosts the profile of American companies in Formula One, which was acquired by US-based Liberty Media in 2017.
Red Bull count retail giant Walmart among its partners, while US-headquartered multinational Cognizant are joint title sponsors of the Aston Martin team.
New York-based investment group MSP Sports Capital has a significant minority stake in McLaren while Dorilton Capital acquired Williams in 2020, making them the second US-owned team after Haas.
America, where the sport has been steadily gaining popularity thanks in part to Netflix series 'Drive to Survive', is an important market for Formula One.
The country will have two races on the calendar this year with the Miami Grand Prix, scheduled for May, joining October's US Grand Prix in Austin, Texas.","['326_0', '326_1']","['\n      Oracle signage is seen outside Mocsone Center during Oracle OpenWorld 2012 in San Francisco, California, on Oct 1, 2012.

""A lot is unknown about the car,"" said the 24-year-old, standing alongside team mate Sergio Perez, at the launch of his new RB18 unveiled virtually on Wednesday.
""That's why I'm also very curious to see how the car is behaving on track.
""I'm really looking forward to that first moment when you drive out of the pit lane and do the first few laps.""
Formula One cars this year will feature cleaner swept back aerodynamics aimed at improving wheel-to-wheel racing and bigger 18-inch wheels, as part of a radical regulatory overhaul.
Verstappen, who has driven the car on Red Bull's simulator, said it had less grip than the previous generation of Formula One challengers. 
But he said the view from the cockpit was the biggest change to get used to. 
""For me, actually, the biggest thing is just the view in the cockpit with these big tyres,"" said Verstappen.
""To hit an apex in some tight corners is a bit more difficult.""
Red Bull's new car will sport a slightly tweaked livery this year.
The changes include a prominent display of Oracle branding on the car, with the software giant expanding its partnership with the team to become its title sponsor.
The car will no longer carry Honda stickers, with the Japanese manufacturer having officially pulled out of the sport.
Instead, it now features smaller HRC (Honda Racing Company) branding, to reflect Red Bull's scaled down collaboration with the Japanese company.
It also sports the 'number 1' with Verstappen becoming the first reigning champion to swap out his personal number for the world champion's digit since Sebastian Vettel in 2014.
Team principal Christian Horner described the rule changes as the biggest in 30 years. 
Repeating last year's title success for Verstappen, who fought a down-to-the-wire battle with Mercedes rival Lewis Hamilton before clinching the title in controversial circumstances at the Abu Dhabi finale, would be the biggest challenge, he added.
""We've got massive competition out there,"" said Horner.
""But motivation is sky high, and we're riding on the crest of a wave from last year.""

Aston Martin finished seventh out of 10 teams last year, with Vettel scoring the team's best result with a second-place finish in Azerbaijan.
However, the 2022 season featuring one of the sport’s biggest rule overhauls ever - with cars having revised aerodynamics and 18-inch wheels instead of the previous 13-inch versions - could upset the form book.
""I’ve had good years and not so good years, but, mostly I would say good years, great years with a very competitive car and a very competitive team,"" Vettel, who will be heading into his 15th full season in Formula One, told reporters at the launch of the new-look AMR-22.
""Ultimately, having had the path that I had so far, I’m mostly interested in winning and that will determine what the future brings.""
Vettel, who joined Aston Martin from Ferrari in 2021, is out of contract at the end of the season.
Winner of four straight drivers' titles with Red Bull between 2010-2013, the 34-year-old last tasted victory at the 2019 Singapore Grand Prix when he was still with Ferrari.
The win was the 53rd of the German's career. Only Lewis Hamilton on 103 victories and boyhood hero Michael Schumacher with 91 wins have more.
Aston Martin owner Lawrence Stroll, the Canadian billionaire who bought the outfit out of administration in 2018 when it ran as Force India, has big ambitions for the squad.
He has hired top names from other teams and is building a new factory and wind tunnel. He also recruited Vettel to help build the team into a championship contender.
The upcoming season is only the second of a five-year plan to championship success that Stroll has set out.
""Ideally accelerate it a little bit,"" Vettel, who races alongside Stroll's son Lance, joked at the launch.
""I think this year will be a true test for us and we will see how good we are.
""Last year we couldn’t show anything because we didn’t focus on bringing any updates. This year it’s all about … this generation of cars and we will be able to show what we can produce and we should be measured based on that.""

Masi has come under fire for his decision to alter the safety car procedure by getting only the lapped cars between race-leading Hamilton and second-placed rival Max Verstappen out of the way after a late-race crash.
The decision set up a last-lap showdown between the two title rivals and allowed Verstappen, on fresher tyres, to pass Hamilton and win his first title.
“It’s not the easiest sometimes to be in the shoes of the referee or Michael’s shoes,” said four-times champion Vettel ahead of the launch of his Aston Martin team's new car for 2022.
“But I think he’s done a great job especially filling in after (former F1 race director) Charlie (Whiting) passed away so sudden ...”
The governing FIA has launched an investigation into the controversy, which has prompted speculation about Hamilton's future in the sport.
The outcome of the investigation, led by the FIA's executive director of single seaters Peter Bayer, will be put before the Formula One Commission next week. 
Final decisions are expected to be announced at the World Motor Sport Council on March 18, the same day as Friday’s practice for the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix.   
Bayer said in an interview with Austrian newspaper Vorarlberger Nachrichten that the FIA were looking at dividing Masi’s tasks as race director to ease his workload.
Yet he also raised the possibility that there could be a new race director. 
Masi stepped into the role of race director after respected predecessor Whiting died suddenly on the eve of the 2019 season.
“I don’t know either what’s his future but I hope he sticks around because I think overall he did a very, very good job,” said Vettel. 
“I think there’s a lot of controversy for the last race.

The Gulf island kingdom, which held its first race in 2004, is set to host this year’s season opener on March 20, having also hosted the first round last year.
In addition it held two races on two different layouts of its Sakhir track during the COVID-19 pandemic-shortened 2020 season.
""I am delighted we will be racing at the Bahrain International Circuit until 2036,"" Formula One chief executive Stefano Domenicali said in a statement.
""Since 2004 we have had some fantastic races in Sakhir and we cannot wait to be back there for the start of the 2022 championship,"" he said.
Friday's news means Formula One will continue to have at least four races in the region for the foreseeable future.
Abu Dhabi, which joined the island kingdom as the second Middle Eastern race in 2009 and typically hosts the season finale, agreed a new deal in December last year keeping it on the calendar until at least 2030.
Saudi Arabia joined the schedule for the first time last year with a deal spanning at least 10 years.
Qatar, which also held its first race in 2021 as a COVID-19 stand-in, is set to return to the calendar in 2023 on a 10-year deal, after hosting the soccer World Cup later this year.
The news reflects the Middle East’s growing profile and influence within the sport. 
Last week Saudi energy giant Aramco, already a major Formula One sponsor, announced a partnership with Aston Martin.
Emirati ex-rally driver Mohammed ben Sulayem was elected the first non-European president of the sport’s governing FIA in December, while British supercar makers McLaren are majority-owned by Bahrain's sovereign investment fund Mumtalakat, with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) also providing significant funding.
""The growth and interest in motorsport in Bahrain and the Middle East has significant momentum, with a new generation of fans embracing our great sport,"" said Bahrain International Circuit chief executive Sheikh Salman bin Isa Al Khalifa.

The Renault-owned team will incorporate BWT's pink colour scheme into its traditional blue as part of the deal starting this season and will be renamed the BWT Alpine F1 Team, it said in a statement.
The long-term agreement will also involve Alpine and BWT working together to ""spread the message of sustainability around the world utilising the combined global platforms of Formula One and the automotive industry,"" the pair added.
It will include the setting up of bottle-free zones at Alpine's factories and at races as part of eliminating single use plastics.
BWT previously sponsored rivals Aston Martin, with the partnership going back to the team's Racing Point and Force India days.
The Silverstone-based outfit last week announced the signing of Saudi energy giant Aramco as their joint title partners.
BWT's tie-up with Alpine, whose drivers are double world champion Fernando Alonso and Frenchman Esteban Ocon, had been expected for some time.
Aston Martin's former team principal Otmar Szafnauer who left the team in January has also been linked with a move to the French manufacturer.
Alpine finished fifth in the overall standings last year, with Ocon handing the team their first win since 2013, and are hoping to move up the field this season.
They are set to unveil their new car, designed to radically overhauled regulations aimed at improving wheel-to-wheel racing, on Feb. 21 before the record 23-race season gets under way in Bahrain on March 20.

The decision set up a last-lap showdown between the two rivals and allowed Verstappen, on fresher tyres, to pass Hamilton and deny the Briton an unprecedented eighth title.

""He’s going to every track before, checking out also for other things whether it's safety or whatever. So his schedule is nuts.”
Formula One ran a 22-race season in 2021 and is set for a record 23 rounds this year.
Masi, the only other high-profile Australian in the sport other than Ricciardo, stepped into the role of race director after the sudden death of the respected Charlie Whiting in 2019.
Apart from running the on-track sessions, his job includes safety-related responsibilities like track inspections and visits to new circuits to sign off on their layout.

The car features sleek, swept-back aerodynamics and bigger 18-inch wheels, sporting the 2022 look ushered in by a radical rules overhaul aimed at improving wheel-to-wheel racing. 
McLaren, who also launched their IndyCar challenger and their Extreme E team on Thursday, returned to winning ways last season with Ricciardo handing the team their first Formula One victory since 2012 at the Italian Grand Prix in Monza.
The team were on course to finish third in the overall standings but slipped behind Ferrari towards the end of the season.
The 2022 rules could shake up the form book but McLaren, who are still building the team up into a championship-fighting force, are cautious about their chances of making big leaps up the order.
“For me the most important thing is that we keep this positive momentum up, that we keep making steps as a team,” said team principal Andreas Seidl. 
“We want to get back to fighting for race wins regularly and fighting for championships again in the future. 
“But at the same time we know the reality that we still have some important building blocks like the wind tunnel and the infrastructure side to finish in the next two years,” added the German.

Ricciardo, an eight-time grand prix winner, endured a difficult season last year as he struggled to adapt to his new surroundings having moved from Renault to McLaren.
He handed the former champions their first win since the Brazilian Grand Prix in 2012, leading team mate Lando Norris in a one-two in Monza. 
But, he was otherwise outperformed by the younger Briton, who took four podiums and finished sixth in the overall standings. 
Ricciardo was eighth, with the Monza win his sole podium finish.  
“There’s always going to be pressure in this sport, whether it’s from the team or even from the outside,” said Ricciardo at the launch of McLaren’s 2022 car. 
“But it’ll always be me who puts it on myself."" 
The 2022 season will see cars designed to radically new rules featuring revised aerodynamics and larger 18-inch wheels.
Ricciardo, who finished third in the drivers standings for Red Bull behind only the dominant Mercedes pair in 2014 and 2016, was optimistic the reset would help him rediscover his groove.
“(I’m putting) a lot of emphasis on just getting up to speed with this car and proving that I still am one of the top guys on the grid and proving that Monza can happen again.”
""To have a change now is sort of like new optimism, a new chance, so that's exciting."" 
Ricciardo also said McLaren’s decision to secure 22-year-old Norris for the long term, announced earlier this week, with a contract keeping him at the team until the end of 2025 was a good move for both.
He added he was happy with his own deal, which ends in 2023 with options for future years, and not concerned that the team were building their future around his younger team mate.
“I guess I’m probably at that point now in my career where I’m not desperate to lock down a five-year contract or something,” said the 32-year-old.
""It’s more just really assessing me probably first and foremost and where I kind of feel I’m sitting.

The squad extended their streak of record constructors' title wins to eight last year but failed to make it a successive eighth title double after a controversial safety car call allowed Red Bull rival Max Verstappen to pass Hamilton on the last lap of the season-ending Abu Dhabi race to score his first championship triumph.
The loss was the dominant team's first championship defeat of the turbo hybrid era that began in 2014.
It denied them a clean sweep of titles in the final year under those rules, with 2022 ushering in a radical regulation overhaul.
""I think following the conclusion of last year, there’s so much motivation and fire within the whole factory to bounce back,"" said Russell in a pre-recorded interview released by Mercedes. ""And that is incredible for me to see.""
Russell, whose career has been supported by Mercedes, joins the Brackley-based squad after three years at power unit customer Williams where he had been placed to learn the ropes.
The 23-year-old put in a cameo as a stand-in for Hamilton, sidelined by COVID-19, at the 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix, very nearly winning on his Mercedes debut.
""In a way it feels like returning home to people who I’ve known for such a long time,"" said Russell.
""Because I’ve spent so much time with the team prior to joining Williams in Formula One as a junior driver, I feel like I know everybody so well already.""
Russell is set to line up alongside seven-times champion Hamilton this season.

316,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/storied-ex-mclaren-boss-whitmarsh-building-aston-martin-f1-success-2496726,Storied ex-McLaren boss Whitmarsh building up Aston Martin for F1 success,"    Aston Martin’s Formula One chief executive Martin Whitmarsh said leading the British manufacturer to title success would rank as the greatest achievement of his storied career.
The Briton, who spent 24 years with McLaren winning a combined 10 drivers' and constructors’ titles before being ousted in 2014, returned to F1 in his current role last October.
The target set by Canadian billionaire owner Lawrence Stroll is clear - win the championship. 
""For me, to see a great brand, Aston Martin, up on the top step of the Formula One podium will be incredibly satisfying,"" Whitmarsh, still McLaren’s last title-winning team boss having won the 2008 title with Lewis Hamilton, told Reuters in an interview.
""Frankly that’s why I’m here,"" added the 63-year-old, who after leaving McLaren spent a stint as chief executive of Olympic yachtsman Ben Ainslie’s America’s Cup challenge. 
Stroll, who bought the Silverstone-based team out of administration in 2018 when it was called Force India and rebranded it Aston Martin last year, has big ambitions for the British marque, which finished seventh in the overall standings last year.
He has set the team the target of fighting for the championship within five years and is building a new factory and wind tunnel. 
The 2022 season is the second year of that plan.
‘ADDICTIVE TOPIC’
Hiring Whitmarsh, together with other top names from rival teams as well as four-time champion Sebastian Vettel, underscores those ambitions.
As chief executive of the newly-created Aston Martin Performance Technologies, which includes the F1 team, Whitmarsh has a wide remit. 
But, even though the British marque signed former BMW motorsport head Mike Krack as its new F1 team principal, his time has been consumed transforming the squad from a midfield outfit punching above its weight into a genuine front-runner.   
“Formula One is quite an addictive topic, I have to say,” said Whitmarsh.
“So at the moment I’m giving quite a lot of time and energy to that. 
“Therefore I’m going to be pretty involved. 
“I think I have a reasonable amount of influence on the success or otherwise of the team in the coming years.”
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE
When Whitmarsh left F1 in 2014, he said he was saddened by the state it was in.
The sport he returns to has undergone significant change.
Commercial rights holders Liberty Media have expanded its reach to new fans, while the success of Netflix show ‘Drive to Survive’ has seen its popularity soar in the hard-to-crack U.S. market.
The sport has committed to achieving net-zero carbon status by 2030, it has rolled out a diversity and inclusion platform and there is now an enforceable cost cap in place, which Whitmarsh played a role in formulating.
“I think Formula One has been a little bit arrogant, a little bit inward looking in the past,” he said.
“What it’s really learnt is we have to be relevant to society, to the needs of society, otherwise you just don’t make that connection.”
NEW SPONSORS
F1’s growing appeal has drawn in a wave of new sponsors, particularly from America and the Middle East.
Aston Martin has partnered with Saudi energy company Aramco, already a major F1 sponsor. 
The sport’s move towards using 100per cent sustainable fuels by 2025, giving oil companies a test-bed to develop sustainable fuels for the road, was key to the deal. 
“Actually in a racing team, there’s an opportunity to apply directly those technologies for example together,” said Aramco chief technology officer Ahmad Al Khowaiter. 
“That’s the potential, it’s to do more of what we’re already doing.”

The car, which will be raced by an unchanged driver line-up of Pierre Gasly and Yuki Tsunoda and features a similar livery to last year, has been designed to Formula One's radical new rules which are aimed at improving wheel-to-wheel racing.
It also sports the larger, new for 2022, 18-inch wheels.
""It’s a fresh start for all the teams, starting pretty much from zero as we are really looking at a clean sheet of paper scenario,"" said Frenchman Gasly, who enjoyed a strong season last year and scored points in 15 of the 22 races in a Q&A issued by the team.
""It will be a big challenge for the teams to work out how to build the best car possible to comply with the new regulations.
""I hope that it works really well for us.
""I have no doubts about our team’s abilities and, as of now, they are quite pleased with the work they have done.""
AlphaTauri's 2022 car will no longer feature Honda's 'H' branding, with the Japanese manufacturer having officially pulled out of the sport. Instead, like with sister team Red Bull, it will carry smaller HRC (Honda Racing Company) stickers as the firm will continue to make engines for both outfits this season and provide trackside support.
Tsunoda, whose career has been backed by Honda, said he aimed to have a more consistent year.
The 21-year-old showed flashes of speed but made too many mistakes in his rookie campaign in 2021 before ending it on a high with a fourth-place finish at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
""I want to improve my pace and the consistency in the way I drive,"" said Tsunoda.
""If I can work the way I did at the last three or four races of last year, that will be a good way to start.""
Haas, Red Bull, Aston Martin and McLaren have all already launched their cars. 
Williams are set to take the wraps off their challenger on Tuesday with Ferrari launching their car on Thursday.
Constructors' champions Mercedes will unveil their 2022 car on Friday.     
The 2022 season is set to get underway on March 20 in Bahrain.

314,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/formula-one-hold-three-sprint-races-2022-2498256,Formula One to hold three sprint races in 2022,"Formula One approved a plan to hold three sprint races instead of six in 2022 at an F1 Commission meeting on Monday(Feb 14), the FIA said in a statement.
The move will see the sprint format used at races in Imola's Emilia Romagna Grand Prix and the Austrian and Brazilian Grands Prix, the FIA said in a statement.
The sport was set to roll the format out across six events this season after having trialled it at three grands prix last year.
But the plan met opposition from Mercedes, Red Bull and Ferrari, who wanted an increase in the cost cap to account for the increased number of sprint events.
The plan for three sprint events was unanimously approved, the FIA said. It follows a compromise proposed by Formula One bosses, keeping the cost cap intact but scaling back the number of sprint events to three.
The Formula One Commission also agreed a change to the points structure for the sprint races, with a maximum eight points on offer and points awarded down to eighth place.
The sprint is a shorter 100km race that will be held on Saturdays. Placings in the sprint will decide driver positions on the starting grid for Sunday's main race.
Qualifying is brought forward to Friday and decides the starting order for the sprint race.
However, following complaints raised last year, the fastest driver in Friday's qualifying will be awarded 'pole position' for the sake of the record books, even if they end up lower down in Saturday's sprint race. Friday's placings in qualifying will have no bearing on actual grid positions on Sunday.
The Commission also approved changes to the sporting regulations to avoid a repeat of last season's rain-hit Belgian Grand Prix, when the result was declared and half-points awarded after completing only the minimum number of laps behind the safety car.
Going forward, no points will be awarded unless drivers have completed at least two laps without a safety car or virtual safety car intervention, the FIA said.
Points will now be awarded on a sliding scale in the case of a shortened race depending on how much distance has been covered.",['314_0'],"[""\nFormula One drivers including Red Bull's Max Verstappen will have a sprint qualifying session at three races this season AFP/Miguel MEDINA\n""]"

Williams became the sixth team to officially launch their 2022 season, first unveiling their new livery on a show car before giving Albon and teammate Nicholas Latifi a turn behind the wheel of their contender in a shakedown run.
Held at a wet and cold Silverstone on demonstration tyres, the run was far from representative.
Neither driver was close to the limit but Albon was positive in his initial assessment of the car.
""It was wet for us so maybe a little bit harder to compare to from previous years but honestly it feels like a racing car,"" said the British-born Thai racer, who is making his racing comeback as a replacement for Mercedes-bound George Russell after a year on the sidelines as reserve driver for Red Bull.   
""I think once we get towards the latter end of testing when we start seeking the true gains of the car, putting it on its limits, then we’ll really see what the car is like on the limit,"" added the 25-year-old.
Williams are looking to build on their performance from last season when they returned to the points with six top-10 finishes, including a second place for Russell at the Belgian Grand Prix.
That earned them eighth in the standings, snapping a streak of three consecutive years as the sport's bottom team.
Formula One this season is set for its most radical overhaul in decades.
The new regulations are aimed at improving wheel-to-wheel racing, with cars featuring revised aerodynamics and larger, 18-inch (45.72-cm) wheels, giving them a new look.
The changes have also resulted in a loss of downforce for the 2022 cars compared to their 2021 predecessors, billed the fastest cars in history, and altered their handling characteristics. 
""It definitely feels very different to last year for sure,"" said Latifi.
""It feels like you're driving a heavier car but beyond that I was nowhere near the limit."" 
Williams, which was bought by U.S.-based Dorilton Capital in 2020 and whose founder Frank Williams died in November, last won the drivers' and constructors' championships with Jacques Villeneuve in 1997.
Their last race win was with Pastor Maldonado at the Spanish Grand Prix in 2012.
Their new car has a diamond-patterned, blue livery with touches of red.

As the global spotlight dazzles on the elfin teenager, uncomfortable questions swirl around the sport and whether or not the minimum age for competitors - currently 15 - needs to be raised.
American Mariah Bell skated in the women's singles on Tuesday (Feb 15), and as she left the ice took a swipe at minors competing on the biggest stage.
""I absolutely believe that there should be an age limit,"" the 25-year-old said, when asked if the limit should be 17.
""I know for me, personally, I know when you’re growing there’s a lot of changes happening. There are minors competing ... that's a whole different thing.""
On Tuesday, Valieva finished top in the short programme of the women's competition, dominating the event only a day after being cleared to skate by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, a decision that sparked global condemnation.
Child stars are hardly new in figure skating, and teenagers have won the women's singles gold medal in six of the past seven Olympics.
However, Valieva's positive drug test has shone light on a world where children are trained relentlessly in the pursuit of medals, and then quickly disappear as puberty changes their bodies and their results decline.
The treadmill of child figure skating champions has only quickened in recent years with the emergence of a dominant Russian programme spearheaded by Valieva's coach Eteri Tutberidze.
The 47-year-old's teenage prodigies are among few female skaters who can execute the quadruple jumps that produce high scores in competition and offer a key advantage.
Biomechanics experts say that younger skaters may have an advantage with the quad because their narrow hips and shoulders could help them rotate faster in the air.
It's a formula that has proved hugely successful for Russian figure skating while often leaving a short shelf-life for the athletes concerned.
Swedish skater Josefin Taljegard said that was something that needs to be addressed.
Pushing back on the suggestion the age limit should be lifted, she said: ""It is difficult to answer because we don't want the junior (world championships) to be better than the normal worlds.
""It's not like Valieva isn't good at performing,"" the 26-year-old added. ""If it was only the jumps, then maybe, but they're good at everything, so it's so hard to say. Maybe instead of putting a lower age limit, encouraging people to stay in the sport a little bit longer.""",['312_0'],"[""\nKamila Valieva of the Russian Olympic Committee in action during the Beijing Winter Olympics women's figure skating single short programme at the Capital Indoor Stadium in Beijing on Feb 15, 2022.

311,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/williams-drop-senna-logo-livery-break-past-2500611,Williams drop Senna logo from livery in break from the past,"    The Williams Formula One team have decided to remove logos paying tribute to fallen Brazilian great Ayrton Senna from their cars starting this season, with the former champions making a break with the past and embarking on a new era.
The triple champion, hailed and mourned as one of the greatest talents the sport has ever seen, was killed while racing for the Grove-based team in 1994 at Imola in only his third race as a Williams driver.
The team cars have carried various iterations of the Senna logo, from the trademark Senna 'S' to special edition stickers, every year starting 1995.   
""The decision was that we want to move on in the future,"" team principal Jost Capito told reporters shortly after the outfit unveiled their new livery for the 2022 season.
""We have a new era, we have a new car and we refurbished also our museum where we have a special area to celebrate Ayrton.
""We had to look now in the future and not showing the drivers the 'S' all the time they get in the car and being reminded on what happened.""
Capito said Williams, who also fielded the Brazilian's nephew Bruno Senna for a season in 2012, had not discussed the move with the Senna family.
But he said the team were looking to work more closely with the Senna Foundation, a philanthropic organisation set up by Senna's sister Viviane in 1994.  
""More people benefit from this and if we can help people especially through the foundation, I think that’s a very good programme but it has to be still finely defined,"" said Capito.
Williams, who unveiled a blue diamond-pattered livery with splashes of red, used the launch which coincides with the most radical Formula One rules overhaul in decades to emphasise a departure from the past and signal the dawn of a new era.
The team were sold by the Williams family to U.S.-based Dorilton Capital in the second half of 2020. Team founder Frank Williams, under whose leadership the outfit won nine constructors' championships, seven drivers' titles and 114 races, died last November at the age of 79.
""I think now it’s time for the team to move on and be very honourable to Senna and having a very dedicated space in the museum and honour him there,"" said Capito.

310,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/f1-braced-disputes-over-new-2022-rules-2503456,F1 braced for disputes over new 2022 rules,"    Formula One is braced for disputes over teams' interpretations of this season's new rules, but will now have the power to crack down swiftly on any outfit trying to use loopholes to circumvent them, the sport's motorsport head Ross Brawn said.
The series is set for its most radical regulatory overhaul in decades, aimed at levelling the playing field and improving wheel-to-wheel racing.
In the past, Formula One teams have occasionally protested each other's interpretations of the rules and Brawn is aware that the new regulations could spark disputes as engineers seek out loopholes in order to steal a march on their rivals.  
""It wouldn’t be F1 without disputes,"" the 67-year-old, who as team principal of his eponymous Brawn team had to fend off protests over the car's double diffuser at the start of their title-winning campaign in 2009, told reporters.
""...So it would be naive to think we’re not going to have arguments.""
The governing FIA, which has been inspecting teams' 2022 challengers for compliance with the new rules, has already found some ""surprises"" the body's single seater head Nikolas Tombazis said.
But there had not been any massive ""alarm bells"" so far, he added.
Brawn said the altered governance system, which allows changes to be made with the support of the FIA, commercial rights holder FOM and at least eight of the 10 teams, would discourage outfits from straying too far from the regulations in their search for a loophole.
It would also give the sport the ability to outlaw anything too controversial.    
""If you know that eight teams and the FIA and F1 can stop you doing something if they feel it’s wrong then you’re a bit more circumspect in doing it knowing that that could be an issue,"" he said. 
""So I think the governance is something which also gives another layer of protection.""
The 2022 season has a tough act to follow after 2021 served up plenty of drama and the closest title battle in decades between Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen.
The change in regulations could spread the field out, Brawn cautioned, but will eventually put more teams in the mix. 
""There will be a bit of disparity in the beginning,"" he said. 
""But I’m confident these rules and this regime and this culture will lead to much better racing.""

309,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/masi-replaced-f1-race-director-after-abu-dhabi-controversy-2504911,Masi replaced as F1 race director after Abu Dhabi controversy,"    Australian Michael Masi has been replaced as Formula One race director in the wake of the title-deciding safety car controversy in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the governing FIA's new president said on Thursday.
Masi, who will be offered a new role within the FIA, will be replaced by Niels Wittich and Eduardo Freitas who will share the race director job as part of a wider restructuring of the sport's refereeing process unveiled on Thursday by the governing body's president Mohammed Ben Sulayem.
Freitas moves into the F1 role having served as race director to sports car racing's World Endurance Championship, including the 24 Hours of Le Mans. 
Wittich, who worked in German touring car series DTM, was already set to step up into the role of Masi's deputy this year having been part of race control last season.
Freitas and Wittich will alternate in the race director role as part of the new race control management team which will be in place in time for the first pre-season test in Barcelona on Feb. 23. 
They will be assisted by FIA stalwart Michael 'Herbie' Blash who will return as permanent senior advisor, having retired in 2016 after 50 years in the sport.
Blash served as deputy to the highly-respected Charlie Whiting. 
The pair, who worked together at the Bernie Ecclestone-owned Brabham team in the 1970s, stepped up to form a crucial double-act in race control in the 1990s.
""Respect and support of the referees is in the essence of the FIA,"" said Ben Sulayem, who in December was elected the body's first non-European president.
""That is why these structural changes are crucial...,"" the Emirati ex-rally driver added.
Masi, who was thrust into the race director role after Whiting's sudden death on the eve of the 2019 season, came under fire when he altered the safety car procedure in December's Abu Dhabi finale to set up a last lap showdown between title rivals Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen. 
The Australian got only the lapped cars between race-leading Hamilton and second-placed rival Verstappen out of the way after a late-race crash, allowing the Red Bull driver to pass his race-leading Mercedes rival seven corners from the finish and take his first title.
Ben Sulayem said unlapping procedures behind the safety car will be reassessed and presented to a meeting of the F1 Commission ahead of the start of the upcoming season. 
He said a virtual race control room, operating in a similar way to football's VAR, would be set up away from the track to assist the race director in the decision-making process.
Direct radio communications during the race, broadcast live on TV, will also be removed to shield the race director from external pressure, after Red Bull and Mercedes team bosses Christian Horner and Toto Wolff were heard repeatedly contacting Masi over the radio to lobby, complain or vent their frustrations during several races last year.
Teams will still be able to contact the race director but through a non-intrusive process.
The changes were unanimously supported by the teams and F1 chief executive Stefano Domenicali at an F1 Commission meeting on Monday, said Ben Sulayem.
""These changes will enable us to start the 2022 F1 season in the best conditions, and our sport will be even more loved and respected,"" he added.

The Maranello-based squad have raced in every season of Formula One since the championship was founded in 1950 and have won more races and championships than anyone.
They have crowned some of the sport's greats including Juan Manuel Fangio, Alberto Ascari, Niki Lauda and Michael Schumacher.
But their last champion remains now-retired Kimi Raikkonen who won the title in 2007.
Last year the team, despite bouncing back from a dismal 2020 to take third in the constructors' standings, went without a win for the second season in a row.
""Our objective for 2022 certainly is being back to being competitive and being competitive means being capable of winning races,"" team principal Mattia Binotto told reporters following the car's launch on Thursday.
""That's the way we see it at the moment and I think we will be pretty happy if we will be in that position."" 
Formula One is introducing its biggest rules shake up in decades, with cars featuring revised aerodynamics and bigger 18-inch wheels aimed at improving the racing spectacle.
The new rules could shake up the established order and Ferrari, who unveiled a stunning new car done up in a red and black livery in a throwback to the past, are clearly eyeing this season as an opportunity. 
The word innovation was repeatedly used during the launch of the challenger, designated the F1-75 mark 75 years since founder Enzo Ferrari manufactured the first car to bear his name.
At the same time the new rules are a step into the unknown. But, despite the uncertainty, Binotto and the team's drivers Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz said the team's efforts into developing the car gave them confidence.
""Of course expectations are high because we are Ferrari, we are the team that is expected to win all the time,"" said Leclerc heading into his fourth season as a Ferrari driver.
""What makes me confident about this year's car is the work that I've seen in the past few months.  
""It's never easy to know until you're really on track for the first qualifying of the year and see the final picture.
""But the feeling is good.""

The federation's newly-elected president Mohammed Ben Sulayem said in a video posted online on Thursday (Feb 17) that the Australian will be replaced by Niels Wittich and Eduardo Freitas who will alternate as race directors.
The Emirati, who said Masi would be offered another role within the FIA, also announced other changes.
These include the setting up of a virtual race control room, similar to football's VAR, a reassessment of safety car unlapping procedures, the return of F1 stalwart Herbie Blash as permanent senior advisor to the two race directors and an end to the broadcasting of radio transmissions between teams and race control.      
""I actually like what I see,"" Sainz told reporters following the launch of Ferrari's 2022 car.
""I also welcome the new race directors and I’m sure they will have a very difficult task to complete like we saw the last few years in Formula One.
""It’s a very difficult role, especially filling in the shoes of the late Charlie that we all definitely miss.
""But we also accept this role needs to be done properly, needs to be done supported, like the FIA is planning.""

The Renault-owned manufacturer announced the signing of the Romanian-American as new team principal on Thursday, having had former Suzuki motor racing boss Davide Brivio and Marcin Budkowski sharing the role last year.
""I want to say that the old structure was not 'not working',"" Rossi told Reuters and two other journalists in a select media round-table.
""We went through the season, we never made a fool of ourselves, it was just fine. 
""Now was it the right structure to move forward and take the team to the next level because the team has been plateauing and rather was in almost a negative slope.""
Alpine, who competed as Renault until the end of 2020, returned to the top step of the podium with a win for Frenchman Esteban Ocon in Hungary but finished fifth in the standings last season for the third year in a row.
Their target is to fight for the championship within 100 races of the start of Formula One's new rules era, which begins with the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix on March 20.
Szafnauer's appointment, which was announced alongside that of former Peugeot Sport head and FIA deputy secretary general of sport Bruno Famin as head of Alpine's power unit operations, follows a review of the team's old structure Rossi began in November last year.
Budkowski left Alpine in January following the review and Brivio has been moved on to a broader talent development role, the team said.  
Rossi said Szafnauer, a long-time F1 insider, who previously worked with Honda before moving to Force India which became Aston Martin last year, would be able to unify the team's operations across their Enstone headquarters, power unit base in Viry-Chatillon and at the race track.
He said the 57-year-old had been on the shortlist of team principal candidates and moved swiftly to hire him once he left Aston Martin in January.

The F1 W13 has been designed to F1's radical new rules aimed at improving wheel-to-wheel racing and features the cleaner, swept-back aerodynamics and bigger 18-inch wheels of the new era.
The car, which will be driven by Hamilton and new team mate George Russell who moves up from Williams, also has the return of Mercedes' traditional silver livery after the team ran a black colour scheme in a stand against racism for the last two seasons.
""The hopes are, first of all, that we have a competitive car,"" said team boss Toto Wolff.
""We don’t know whether we’re even in the hunt for another title. 
""My hope is that the car goes fast and that Lewis and George are happy with how it drives and that would be a good starting point.""
Mercedes have dominated the last rules era which began with the introduction of the turbo-hybrid power units in 2014. 
They have won every constructors' title since and would have completed a clean-sweep of title doubles but for a controversial safety car restart at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, which allowed Red Bull's Max Verstappen to pass race-leader Hamilton on the last lap and deny him an eighth title.
""It’s a little bit surreal that as a team we were able to achieve that eight times in a row,"" said Wolff.
""Obviously there was this shadow with the drivers’ championship, Lewis’ championship, the Abu Dhabi situation, but let's look into the future.""
The safety car bungle claimed the job of race director Michael Masi, who altered the restart rules and moved only the lapped cars between Hamilton and Verstappen out of the way, with the governing FIA announcing changes to its race refereeing procedure on Thursday.
It also sparked speculation about Hamilton's future.
""I never ever said I was going to stop,"" said the 37-year-old, speaking publicly for the first time since a post-race broadcast interview following his Abu Dhabi title defeat. 
""It was obviously a difficult time for me and it was a time where I really needed to take a step back.

302,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/wait-till-you-see-me-year-warns-fired-hamilton-2507641,"Wait till you see me this year, warns fired up Hamilton","    Lewis Hamilton said he had never seriously considered stepping away from Formula One following last season's controversial finale and warned rivals he was heading into the 2022 campaign in better shape than ever.   
The Briton went off the grid, disappearing from social media and not speaking publicly, after missing out on a record eighth title when altered safety car rules allowed Red Bull rival Max Verstappen to seize the lead on the last lap of the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. 
At Mercedes’ new car launch on Friday he was back at his fighting best. 
“If you think that what you saw at the end of the last year was my best, wait till you see this year,” declared Hamilton, who won three straight races, including a stirring recovery drive from the back in Brazil, heading into the decider in Abu Dhabi.  
“I always feel like through these sorts of experiences, you can turn that emotion into strength, into power. That’s what I’m doing.”
Hamilton’s silence and team boss Toto Wolff’s comment that the Briton was “disillusioned” had fanned speculation surrounding his future.
The 37-year-old, who is the sport's most successful driver with 103 race wins, said questioning whether he had the motivation to return was something he did every year.
“I think at the end of seasons you think and the question is whether you’re willing to commit the time, the effort that it takes to be a world champion,"" he said.
“But of course this one was compounded by a significant factor.
“But I’m generally a very determined person and I like to think to myself, whilst moments like this might define someone’s career, I refuse to let this define mine.”
F1's governing FIA on Thursday removed Australian Michael Masi, who made the controversial safety car call, as race director in an overhaul of the sport’s refereeing process. 
Hamilton said he welcomed the changes but his faith in the system would take time to be rebuilt.
“I think accountability is key and we have to use this moment to make sure this never happens to anybody else in the sport ever again,” he added.
Hamilton, who spent the winter with his family, also said he bore no grudge towards rival Verstappen.
“I never think that’s ever a good thing to carry around with you,” he said.
“I don’t have anything over my shoulders holding me back this year.
“... I’m not letting that experience be one of those.”

301,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/andretti-apply-f1-team-entry-2024-2508226,Andretti apply for F1 team entry in 2024,":Formula One’s governing FIA said it is not currently in a position to consider interest from new teams, after former world champion Mario Andretti said his son Michael had applied to put a third American-owned outfit on the grid by 2024.
Andretti senior announced the news on Twitter and in a subsequent interview with the Indianapolis Star said the team had even secured a power unit partner.  
""His (Michael Andretti's) entry, Andretti Global, has the resources and checks every box. He is awaiting the FIA's determination,"" the 1978 world champion wrote on Twitter.
“They’re far enough along that, if they get the approval to be added to the 10 teams that exist in F1, they’re ready to go the next day and put everything in place,"" he later told the paper, adding the team would be based in England with the cars built in Indianapolis.
The application, if successful, would make Andretti Global the sport's third U.S.-owned squad after Haas and Williams, which was acquired by Dorilton Capital in 2020.
New York-based investment group MSP Sports Capital also has a significant minority stake in McLaren. 
The FIA, however, said it was not yet considering any new teams.
“The FIA is not currently in a position to consider or comment on any expressions of interest or applications received from potential new entrant teams in respect of the FIA Formula One World Championship,” said a spokesperson for the Paris-based body.
Michael Andretti, who already has interests in IndyCar, Formula E, Extreme E  and sportscars, held talks to buy Alfa Romeo last year.
The former IndyCar champion who briefly raced in F1 for McLaren, in November said the negotiations broke down over “control issues”.
Commercial rights holders Formula One Management, who were acquired by U.S.-based Liberty Media in 2017, did not comment, but have previously described the sport’s current count of 10 teams as a good number.
F1 has had limited success with new teams in the recent past, with Haas, who joined in 2016, the exception. 
It has put in place measures like a cost cap and a fairer revenue distribution structure to put its existing teams on a stronger financial footing. 
It has also introduced a $200 million entry fee for new teams to protect existing competitors against a dilution of their share of the prize money.
But the U.S. is a key market for F1, where it has seen a surge in popularity, driven largely by Netflix show ‘Drive to Survive’.
The country will have at least two races on the calendar for the next five years in Austin and Miami, which is set to make its debut this season, while there has been talk of a third race in Las Vegas.
American companies have also been stepping up their involvement in F1.
""They’re all set,"" said Mario Andretti of his son's potential entry in the interview with the Indianapolis Star.
""They’re going in with their eyes wide-open with all the prerequisites.""

300,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/villeneuve-finishes-22nd-daytona-500-debut-2510466,Villeneuve finishes 22nd in Daytona 500 debut,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. :     Former Formula One champion Jacques Villeneuve may not have been able to deliver a fairytale finish to his late-career Daytona 500 debut on Sunday, but impressed in navigating his way through a crash-filled race.
The 50-year-old Canadian, who had failed to qualify for the crown jewel of the NASCAR schedule in his only other attempt 14 years ago, finished 22nd in the season-opening race after having begun last in the 40-car starting lineup.
Villeneuve quickly fell one lap behind the early leaders and then, on lap 38, slid into a half spin without contact while entering the pits before quickly regaining control of his Ford Mustang.
From there, Villeneuve avoided a near catastrophe when he bumped into a spinning Chevrolet driven by Tyler Reddick, who lost control of his car due to a mechanical issue, and was able to carry on mostly among the top 30 racers.
NASCAR Cup rookie Austin Cindric edged out Bubba Wallace in an overtime shootout to win the Daytona 500 while Chase Briscoe finished third.
""Well the checkered flag has flown here at Daytona, and we couldn't be more proud of our guys. @27villeneuve brought it home P22, and even more importantly, has a clean racecar,"" Reaume Brothers Racing, which prepares the cars for Villeneuve's Netherlands-based Team Hezeberg, wrote on Twitter.
Villeneuve qualified on Wednesday when he posted the 36th-fastest lap in pole qualifying, which was enough to beat four of the other non-chartered entries and ensure his spot on the starting grid at Daytona International Speedway.
Villeneuve's motor sports career is about as complete as it gets, but the winner of the 1997 Formula One championship and 1995 Indianapolis 500 said earlier this week qualifying for the Daytona 500 was ""super high"" among his all-time achievement ambitions.

The Renault-owned team's new A522 has been designed to the sport's radical new rules, with the cleaner, swept-back aerodynamics and larger 18-inch wheels, aimed at improving wheel-to-wheel racing.
It also features a revised livery, with the pink colour scheme of new title partner and water technology company BWT mixed in with the team's traditional blue. 
Alpine's target is to fight for the championship within 100 races of the start of Formula One's new rules era, which will begin with the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix on Mar 20.
""In 2022, we want to show constant progress with comprehensive developments across all sites to ensure we are contenders for the title in the future,"" said Alpine chief executive Laurent Rossi.
""We are going in the right direction and we want to carry on our climb to the summit.""
The outfit, who have finished fifth in the constructors' standings for the last three years, recently beefed up their technical department and last week announced the signing of former Aston Martin team boss Otmar Szafnauer as new team principal in a move aimed at reversing their plateauing form.  
The team, who head into 2022 with an unchanged driver line up of double world champion Fernando Alonso and Frenchman Esteban Ocon, returned to the top step of the podium last season, with Ocon handing them their first win since the 2013 Australian Grand Prix in Hungary.
""I've had the displeasure of racing against these formidable competitors,"" said Szafnauer.
""I remember too well when they beat us in Hungary and didn’t put a foot wrong,"" he said referring to Ocon's win ahead of Aston Martin's Sebastian Vettel who finished second on the road but was later disqualified for a fuel irregularity.

298,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/alonso-hoping-competitive-start-new-f1-era-2511931,Alonso hoping for competitive start to new F1 era,"    Double world champion Fernando Alonso is heading into the Formula One season in optimistic mood, with the Spaniard hoping the new 2022 rules can deliver enough of a shake up to put his Alpine team in the fight at the front.
The 40-year-old returned to the sport last year, signing for the same Enstone-based outfit with whom he won his two titles in 2005 and 2006 when they ran as Renault.
But his sights had always been set on the 2022 rules overhaul, billed as the most sweeping in decades.
""I came back to the sport ... because of this regulation,"" said Alonso, at the launch of Alpine's 2022 challenger in Paris, when asked if the new rules could be a game-changer.
""So it has been one year and a half waiting for these cars.""
Formula One's new rules, featuring a complete redesign of the cars, are aimed at delivering better racing.
Together with a more restrictive cost cap, they could put more teams in the mix at the front, if not completely reset the competitive order.  
Renault-owned Alpine, however, are tempering hope with realism.
The team returned to the top step of the podium for the first time since the Australian Grand Prix in 2013, then racing as Lotus, when Alonso's team mate Esteban Ocon took his maiden win in Hungary.
But they finished fifth in the overall constructors' standings for the third year in succession.
Their target is to be in the championship fight within 100 races, starting with the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix.
The outfit recently beefed up their technical department and last week announced the signing of Otmar Szafnauer as their new team principal who joins from rivals Aston Martin.
At Monday's launch, Alpine chief executive Laurent Rossi said progress and momentum would be key.
The team had to aim for at least fifth in the standings again, he added, cautioning that their form relative to competition would only become evident once they hit the track.
Alonso, who scored a podium last year and whose future beyond this season will hinge on how competitive the team can get, said he was confident they were ready to take on 2022.  
""I’m more optimistic than last year probably because the new rules gives you that hope that everything can change and you (can) be competitive from race one,"" he said.

Former world champion Mario Andretti last week announced that his son Michael had made an application to the governing FIA to put a third American-owned team, Andretti Global, on the grid by 2024, joining Haas and U.S.-owned British outfit Williams.
The FIA in response said it wasn't in a position to consider interest from new teams with the sport focused on prioritising the health of its existing ten-strong field.
""I think it’s great that there’s the interest from people wanting to enter Formula One and the Andretti name is certainly a powerful name in motorsport ...,"" said Red Bull team boss Christian Horner at a news conference.
""But there is a clear criteria through the Concorde Agreement that has to be met and approved.""
The latest Concorde Agreement, signed in 2020, introduced a cost cap and a fairer distribution of prize money in order to put teams on a sustainable financial footing.
It also set a $200 million entry fee for new teams to protect existing competitors against a dilution of their share of the prize money.
""We are the absolute pinnacle, this is the Champions League or the NFL and redistributing franchises on the go that’s not how it should be and it’s not the intention of Formula One and the FIA either,"" said Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff.

The year served up one of the closest and most riveting battles in Formula One history as Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen engaged in a no-holds-barred battle of the generations that went all the way down to the last race in Abu Dhabi.
The intensifying fight between the two drivers led to several flashpoints over the course of the year, with the rivals even colliding three times.
But none was as controversial as the Yas Marina finale, in which a last-minute change to safety car rules by race director Michael Masi allowed Verstappen to seize the race lead and the title from Hamilton on the final lap.   
""Look, 2021 has been well-documented,"" Red Bull boss Horner, who engaged in an equally intense off-track war of words with Mercedes rival Wolff, told a news conference on the opening day of the first pre-season test in Barcelona.
""I think that maybe we share a difference of opinion over Abu Dhabi but that’s now done and dusted and all focus is very much now on 2022.""
More than 108 million television viewers tuned in to watch the Abu Dhabi winner-takes-all showdown, with Hamilton and Verstappen going into the race level on points.
Debate over the manner in which the title was decided has rumbled on through the off-season, culminating in a sweeping change to the sport's refereeing process, including Masi's removal as race director, unveiled by the governing FIA last week. 
Wolff, sitting alongside Horner, said it was time to move on.
""There’s been so much talk about Abu Dhabi that it came to a point that it is really damaging for all of us stakeholders of Formula One. We’ve closed the chapter and moved on.""
On his off-track feud with Horner, which included the pair reporting each others' teams and drivers to race stewards, questioning the legality of their cars, casting aspersions on stewards' impartiality and trading direct insults, Wolff said it was only to be expected.

Norris, who had his new MCL36 all to himself, lapped the Spanish Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya in one minute 19.568 seconds on Wednesday, outpacing Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz who shared driving duties for Ferrari.
Seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton was fifth, behind new team mate George Russell, having taken over from the younger Briton after lunch.
Max Verstappen, carrying the number '1' on his Red Bull, was ninth on his first day as defending champion.
""It’s way too early to tell anything,"" Norris told television reporters.
""We’re only in day one of the season and even if we’re amazing now, everything can change by the time we get to the first race.""
Verstappen's new RB18, seen in public for the first time after Red Bull presented their new livery on a show car at their launch, turned heads due to its novel sidepod design.
It also allowed the Dutchman to clock up the highest individual lap count at 147.
""We wanted to get laps in today to get used to the car and to get a general understanding about how it’s behaving,"" said the 24-year-old, who will hand over to team mate Sergio Perez on Thursday.
""Everything worked pretty well, so it was a good start and a positive day.""
As a team, Ferrari covered the most distance with Leclerc and Sainz chalking up a combined 153 laps. Eight of the 10 teams chalked up more than 100 laps.
Haas endured a difficult day as Russian Nikita Mazepin's running was hampered by a cooling leak, while team mate Mick Schumacher's time on track was limited by a damaged floor, meaning the pair completed only a combined 43 laps.
Alfa Romeo recorded the lowest mileage of the day with reserve driver Robert Kubica and former Mercedes driver Valtteri Bottas managing only 32 laps between them.  
Lap times, which count for little in testing with teams and drivers running different programmes and fuel loads, were even less important on Wednesday as teams and drivers familiarised themselves with their radical new cars designed to improve the racing spectacle.
Teams will run their cars in Barcelona for another two days before flying to Bahrain for the official pre-season test from Mar 10-12.

The sport's ruling body announced a raft of changes to the refereeing process governing its races last week, including replacing Masi with two new alternating race directors.
The Australian is to be offered another role within the organisation.
""For me it’s very unfair what happened to Michael because he’s really been thrown under the bus,"" said Verstappen, who seized the race lead and title from Mercedes rival Lewis Hamilton after Masi's decision to move only the lapped cars between the two drivers out of the way played into his hands.
""To immediately sack him for me is not the right decision but I wish him all the best with whatever comes next and I hope it is better than being an F1 race director,"" the Red Bull driver, who said he had texted Masi, told a news conference during pre-season testing in Barcelona.
Masi was promoted to the race director role after highly respected predecessor Charlie Whiting died suddenly on the eve of the 2019 season.
He was under pressure in Abu Dhabi to deliver at least one final lap of racing between the title protagonists, after a late crash triggered the safety car, with the pair having gone into the decider level on points.
He also had to contend with Mercedes and Red Bull bosses repeatedly calling and lobbying him on the radio in the heat of the moment. 
The finale was watched by over 108 million viewers worldwide.
""Of course, people talk about what was decided in Abu Dhabi,"" said Verstappen.
""But can you imagine the referee in whatever sport has the coach or equivalent screaming in his ear all the time - yellow card, red card, no decision, no foul - it’s impossible to make a decision.

Russia launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine by land, sea and air on Thursday, sparking immediate sporting ramifications.
The Champions League final is scheduled to be held in St Petersburg in May but sources have told Reuters that European soccer governing body UEFA is set to move the match to another venue. UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin has called an extraordinary meeting of the Executive Committee on Friday when the issue will be discussed.
The showcase game in European club football was set to be held at Zenit St Petersburg's stadium - known as the Gazprom Arena after a sponsorship deal with Russia's state energy company, which also sponsors the Champions League.
German soccer club Schalke 04 have had a 15-year partnership with Gazprom but said they were removing the firm's logo from their jersey while Matthias Warnig, chief executive of Nord Stream 2 AG, vacated his position on the club's board of directors. Nord Stream 2 AG is owned by Gazprom.
The men's tennis governing body said next week's ATP Challenger event in Moscow will not take place as scheduled due to concerns over player safety and uncertainty related to international travel. 
""The security of players will remain our top priority in assessing the scheduling of subsequent ATP Tour and ATP Challenger Tour events in the region. We continue to monitor the situation,"" the ATP said in a statement to Reuters. 
Athletes from a number of sports also voiced their concerns about travelling to Russia.
Four-times Formula One champion Sebastian Vettel said he will not take part in September's grand prix in Sochi, adding it was ""wrong"" to race in Russia. World champion Max Verstappen agreed with him.
""My own opinion is I should not go,"" Vettel said. ""I'm sorry for the innocent people that are losing their lives, that are getting killed for stupid reasons and a very, very strange and mad leadership.""
The sport's governing body said it was monitoring the situation, but said nothing about potentially moving the Russian Grand Prix.
The invasion was also condemned by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) which said the Russian government had breached the Olympic Truce currently in effect until after next month's Winter Paralympic Games.
MILITARY ESCALATION
A joint statement from the football associations of Poland, Sweden and the Czech Republic called for next month's World Cup playoffs not be played in Russia.
""The signatories to this appeal do not consider travelling to Russia and playing football matches there,"" the statement said. 
""The military escalation that we are observing entails serious consequences and considerably lower safety for our national football teams and official delegations.
Poland are due to play in Russia on March 24 with the winners hosting either Sweden or the Czechs five days later.
EuroLeague Basketball, which has teams from several countries including Russia, said the competition would continue as scheduled unless governmental decisions prevent games from taking place.
""The 18 EuroLeague participating clubs will meet tomorrow to further analyse the course of events and take any necessary actions, if needed,"" it said.
Bayern Munich said their EuroLeague match against CSKA Moscow had been postponed at short notice.    
World Athletics condemned the Russian invasion and said its president Sebastian Coe had contacted senior vice-president Sergey Bubka and the Ukrainian Athletics Federation to offer support.
""We continue to monitor the situation carefully, but there is no reason to believe this will affect plans for the World Athletics Race Walking Team Championships Muscat 22 or the World Athletics Indoor Championships Belgrade 22,"" World Athletics said.
The invasion has also impacted sporting events in Ukraine. 
Soccer matches in the country's Premier League have been suspended due to the imposition of martial law, leaving Shakhtar Donetsk's Italian coach Roberto De Zerbi, his staff and 13 Brazilian players stranded.
""We could have gone home as long as there was security but instead we waited. Last night the explosions woke us up. This morning they suspended the season,"" De Zerbi told Italpress.
Brazilian-born Ukrainian forward Junior Moraes said they were ""prisoners in Kiev"" while waiting for a solution to get out of the country. ""Pray for us,"" he wrote on Instagram.

But he was usurped in the afternoon by Leclerc, who together with fifth-placed Sainz put Ferrari on top of the mileage charts for the second day in a row.
""Our aim is to drive as many kilometres as we can, to complete as many different tests as possible and that’s exactly what we did,"" said Leclerc.
""Again, we should not get ahead of ourselves, because first doesn’t mean anything at this stage."" 
Seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton, who drove for Mercedes in the morning, propped up the timesheets. 
But his new team mate George Russell, who took over after lunch, put the constructors' champions fourth overall.
""Some teams are looking pretty fast,"" said the 24-year-old. 
""A red team and an orange team in particular look very competitive,"" he added referring to Ferrari and McLaren.
""They seem to have things well under control and are on top of everything.
Sergio Perez took over at Red Bull from reigning champion Max Verstappen, who had clocked the highest individual lap count on Wednesday.
GEARBOX ISSUE
But the Mexican's running wasn't as trouble-free as he ground to a halt with a gearbox issue in the morning session, causing the first red flag stoppage of the year.
The 32-year-old did make it back out to end the day with 78 laps and the seventh-fastest time.
Mick Schumacher and Nikita Mazepin bounced back from a difficult opening day to log a combined 108 laps for US-owned Haas.
The Russian, however, lost track time due to a damaged fuel pump, bringing out the second red flag of the day.
Guanyu Zhou, who this season will become the first Chinese Formula One driver, made his testing debut for Alfa Romeo. He completed 71 laps on his way to 10th.
Lap times count for little in testing with teams and drivers running different programmes and fuel loads.
They are also still familiarising themselves with their new cars, which have been radically redesigned to improve the racing spectacle in the biggest rules shake-up in decades.
Several teams struggled with a phenomenon known as ""porpoising"" with the cars bouncing as they sped down the straights.
The Barcelona test will conclude on Friday. The sport will then hold another three days of testing in Bahrain from March 10-12.
The island kingdom will host the season-opening race on March 20.

The all-female motor racing championship announced this week that the 23-year-old, champion in both the series' two seasons, had signed with the Caitlyn Jenner-owned Jenner Racing team for 2022.
The announcement drew criticism of the series, whose objectives include helping women climb the motorsport ladder to Formula One, which has not had a female race driver since Italian Lella Lombardi in 1976.     
""I’ve read a lot of the comments and there is a lot of frustration that I haven’t been able to progress up into the next step in Formula Three or Formula Two,"" Chadwick said on social media on Thursday.
""I also wanted to make that step and I made no secret of that when I won the championship last year.""
Drivers have to bring significant amounts of funding to secure seats in Formula Three and Formula Two, which act as feeder series to Formula One.
Chadwick sees her return to the W Series as a chance to raise the budget to fund the next step in her career.
""I don’t see that as a backward step,"" she said. ""Obviously, this year it’s not going to be F3 or F2 but maybe next year it will.""

""We are watching the developments in Ukraine with sadness and shock and hope for a swift and peaceful resolution to the present situation,"" the sport said in a statement.
""On Thursday evening Formula One, the FIA, and the teams discussed the position of our sport, and the conclusion is ... that it is impossible to hold the Russian Grand Prix in the current circumstances.""
Russia launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine by land, sea and air on Thursday.
Four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel told a news conference that he would not take part in the Russian Grand Prix if it went ahead.
World champion Max Verstappen also said racing in a country at war was ""not correct"".
US-owned Haas ran their car in Barcelona testing on Friday in an all-white livery, having taken off all branding representing title sponsor and Russian potash producer Uralkali.
Team principal Guenther Steiner also acknowledged that the outfit's Russian driver Nikita Mazepin, whose father owns Uralkali, faces an uncertain future.
European soccer's governing body UEFA, earlier on Friday, said it had moved the Champions League final from St Petersburg to Paris.
The cancellation of the Russian race brings Formula One's calendar back down to 22 races from a planned record 23-round schedule.
But the sport, which pulled off 17 races in the pandemic-hit 2020 season and held 22 races last year, has options it can pick to fill the spot vacated by Russia, after a number of venues held races as COVID-19 stand-ins over the last two seasons.
The Russian race debuted on the calendar in 2014 and was set to move to a new track outside St Petersburg from its current Sochi Olympic park venue next year.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has attended the race in the past, even handing out the trophies on the podium.
The title sponsor of the race is the VTB Group whose VTB Bank was hit with sanctions by the United States and Britain following the Russian invasion. ",['288_0'],"[""\nFILE PHOTO: Formula 1 Russian Grand Prix in Sochi Autodrom, Russia on Sep 26, 2021.

Russian troops entered Ukraine through Belarus when the invasion began on Thursday. Ukraine's chief of staff said on Friday that the Russians were now using an airfield in Belarus to line up troops to assault Kyiv.

The 37-year-old Briton surged to the top towards the end of the test's final day, setting his one minute, 19.138 seconds benchmark eight minutes from the finish.
That put him 0.095 seconds clear of compatriot Russell, whose pre-lunch session-topping effort, stood as his best time of the day.
It marked a strong end to the first test for Mercedes, after a low-key opening two days of action, with the reigning constructors' champions also clocking the highest single-day mileage of the test at 160 laps.
""It's not been the easiest or the most smooth running,"" said Hamilton, who had propped up the timesheets on Thursday.
""We definitely had some obstacles to overcome.
""I almost got a 100 laps in today, so for a half day’s running that’s not too bad,"" added the seven-times champion, who took over from Russell for the post-lunch session and single-handedly managed 94 laps. 
Mexican Sergio Perez, swapping with Red Bull team mate Max Verstappen in the afternoon, was third ahead of the reigning champion, with the running order taking on a familiar feel after McLaren's Lando Norris and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc took turns at the top on the opening two days.
But testing times, which, are notoriously difficult to read were made harder to compute with some of Friday afternoon given over to wet weather running on an artificially-drenched track.
Ferrari, who clocked the highest mileage over the three days combined, and McLaren still leave Barcelona in a strong position.
""Overall, this has been a solid test session for us as we completed many laps,"" said Ferrari racing director Laurent Mekies.
""It’s only the first step of a long year, when we intend to push very hard, working all together.""
The final day of running also saw the most red flags, with Fernando Alonso, Chinese rookie Guanyu Zhou, Pierre Gasly and Sebastian Vettel all causing stoppages.
Neither of their teams, with the exception of Alfa Romeo, returned to track action following the lunch break.
Haas, running an all-white livery after stripping their car of all branding related to Russian potash producer and title sponsor Uralkali, managed only nine laps with Nikita Mazepin before the 22-year-old stopped with an oil leak that ended the team's test.
Teams will head to Bahrain for the another three-day test from March 10-12 before the season-opener in the island kingdom on March 20.

Andretti Autosport, with a four car driver lineup that includes F1 veteran Romain Grosjean and 21-year-old American Colton Herta, is a hot favorite to claim the IndyCar championship this season.
But the headlines for much of the week have centred around Andretti's application to join the F1 grid as its 11th team in 2024.
While awaiting world governing body FIA's decision, there have been multiple reports circulating that Andretti has been in discussion to purchase F1 tailenders Haas, who are sponsored by Russian potash producer Uralkali and facing financial headwinds with sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.
Andretti, a former IndyCar champion and grand prix racer, had been in takeover talks with the owners of Sauber, who run the Alfa Romeo team, but said in November last year that ""control issues"" led to a collapse of negotiations.
The son of former-F1 drivers champion Mario Andretti, Michael said had he purchased Sauber that Herta, the youngest race winner in IndyCar Series history when he won at Circuit of The Americas in 2019 at 18 years-old, would have been one of his drivers.
Herta told the IndyStar an opportunity to race Formula One would not be something he could pass up, if FIA approves Andretti's application.
""It's so hard to get into F1, that if an opportunity comes, you can’t just sit and wait around,"" Herta told IndyStar.
Until then, Herta's focus will be on winning the IndyCar drivers title and the St. Petersburg Grand Prix the first of 17 races on the calendar.
While the starting grid will feature a number of 40-somethings, including six-time series champion New Zealander Scott Dixon and four-time Indianapolis 500 winner Helio Castroneves, the series is undergoing a changing of the guard.
Chip Ganassi Racing's 24-year-old Spaniard Alex Palou is back to defend the IndyCar championship he won last year and will be challenged by Arrow McLaren young gun 22-year-old Mexican Pato O’Ward, another driver with Formula One ambition.
A woman will also be back on the grid with Colombia's Tatiana Calderon joining A.J. Foyt Enterprises.
The highlight of 17-race calendar will as always be the Indianapolis 500 on May 29, which will see 46-year-old Castroneves bid to become the first five-time winner and Grosjean racing on the famed oval for the first time having vowed to never take on the treacherous Brickyard.
History also beckons for Dixon as he tries to join A.J. Foyt as the series' only seven-times champion.

The 22-year-old has signed for the Alfa Romeo team alongside former Mercedes racer Valtteri Bottas and will become the first driver from the country of 1.4 billion to line up on the grid at the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix on March 20.
""I don’t want to be in Formula One just for the sake of being here,"" said Zhou in a video released in the official unveiling of Alfa Romeo's 2022 challenger on Sunday.
""I want to be here to be proving myself, to be making my country, making all the people supporting me proud.
""I want to do well in Formula One,"" said Zhou, who graduates after finishing third in the overall standings of the Formula Two series last year.
Zhou's love of motorsport began when he attended his home Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai as a five-year-old in 2004, the first F1 race held in the country.
The fanbase in China has grown steadily since but there is still a huge growth opportunity for the sport in what it sees as a key market. 
Formula One in November extended its contract with the Chinese Grand Prix until 2025.
The race will be absent from the calendar for the third year in a row due to the COVID-19 pandemic this season but the sport has long wanted two races in the country.
Zhou, who was Renault-owned Alpine's test driver last year and a member of their young driver academy, likened himself to NBA trailblazer Yao Ming.
""To be that first one is definitely something very important,"" he said.
""It’s a little bit like Yao Ming for NBA.
""When he shined in the NBA scenario, basketball became a huge sport back home.
""That’s what I’m trying to do now.""

The IOC said on Monday it was recommending that sports organisations do not allow the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials in international competitions.
The announcement led to a host of sports announcing such sanctions, including FIFA and UEFA which suspended Russian national teams and clubs from international football.
Asked if the IOC had made any commitment to lift the sanctions in the event of a ceasefire or peace deal, Bach said that, after long deliberation, the organisation had opted against such an approach.
""We have left this open ... it was very difficult either to set a deadline or to define an event, what could either lead to heavier sanctions or what could lead to a lifting of some of the sanctions,"" Bach told reporters.
""This is why you find in general terms the formula that we are keeping to closely monitor the situation and will adapt depending on the further developments,"" he added.
Bach said no sanctions had been taken directly against the Russian Olympic Committee because it was not responsible for the invasion.
""You can only hold those responsible who are responsible for a breach of the Olympic Charter. And not the Russian people, nor the athletes, nor the Russian Olympic Committee is responsible for this,"" he said.
Bach said he had not spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin since the invasion, that Putin has called ""a special military operation"", adding that he had not been on speaking terms with him ""for a number of years"".
Sports organisations have been cutting commercial ties with Russian companies, including UEFA cancelling its sponsorship deal with energy firm Gazprom.
The German said the IOC had no deals with firms from Russia, but that Russian and Belarusian territories had been removed from the European tender for Olympic broadcast rights which was launched last week.
Belarus has been a key staging area for the invasion of Ukraine.
Bach had made an appeal to ""give peace a chance"" at the closing ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics last month but said the events of the past week had left him horrified.

The Olympic chief repeated his support for athletes speaking out for peace, but said there was little the IOC could do to protect Russian athletes who might face repercussions for such views.
""Again, we are coming to our limits. We have no police force, we have no military. There we can only offer moral support and can help to shed the light on this situation, but there our influence ends,"" he said.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led to sanctions across global sport, and Belarus, a key staging area for the full-scale invasion, has also been punished.
The Winter Paralympics begin on Friday and 71 Russians and 12 Belarusians will not be allowed to participate following threats of boycott from other nations and escalating tension in the athletes' villages in Beijing.
""You are victims of your governments' actions,"" IPC president Andrew Parsons told the affected athletes.
""If Russian and Belarusian athletes stayed in Beijing, nations were likely to withdraw and a viable Games would not have been possible.""
While several nations welcomed the decision, Russia labelled it a ""disgrace"" and is set to file a lawsuit for the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to consider before Friday's opening ceremony.
The Russian Football Union (RFU) is also appealing against the decisions by FIFA and UEFA to bar its teams from international competitions.
The RFU is looking to expedite the process in the hope the punishment is either overturned or suspended so the national team can play in the men's World Cup qualifying playoffs this month.
Poland, Sweden and the Czech Republic, who are in the same qualifying path, had all ruled out playing against Russia.
UEFA also announced that Belarusian clubs and the national team must play their home matches in UEFA competitions at neutral venues with no spectators allowed.
Formula One cancelled the 2022 Russian Grand Prix last week and the sport's commercial rights holder announced on Thursday that the country will not have a race in the future after terminating its contract with the promoter.

Chelsea owner Russian Abramovich's decision to sell the club he bought in 2003 was described as a ""turning point"" by British sports and culture minister Nadine Dorries in parliament as the government looked to target Russian oligarchs with sanctions.

Krack worked with Vettel at BMW-Sauber, with which Vettel made his Formula One race debut in 2007.
Krack was also Vettel's engineer when the German made his first appearance at a grand prix weekend driving for the Switzerland-based team in Friday practice at the 2006 Turkish Grand Prix.
Vettel has since won four titles, chalked up in succession with Red Bull from 2010-2013.
His haul of wins puts him behind only Lewis Hamilton and Michael Schumacher.
However, he hasn't won since the 2019 Singapore Grand Prix when he was still at Ferrari.
Aston Martin finished seventh of the 10 teams in the overall standings last year but the team's billionaire owner, Lawrence Stroll, has big ambitions and has set out a five-year plan to take it to championship success.
The 2022 season, which will feature F1's biggest rules overhaul in decades, is the second year of that plan.
Krack acknowledged that such plans aren't always successful.
But he cited Aston Martin's lean management structure, which includes former McLaren boss Martin Whitmarsh as chief executive at the top, as a strength.
The team had to avoid falling into a ""corporate"" way of working, he said.
""The way we have split the tasks at the moment, we are quick, we are flexible and we can react quicker than others,"" he said.
"" At this stage we have everything that we need."" ",['278_0'],"[""\nFILE PHOTO: Formula One F1- Saudi Arabian Grand Prix - Jeddah Corniche Circuit, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia - Dec 2, 2021. Aston Martin's Sebastian Vettel during the press conference Hassan Ammar/Pool via REUTERS\n""]"

The outfit did not immediately announce a replacement to race alongside German Mick Schumacher, but team boss Guenther Steiner said last week Brazilian reserve Pietro Fittipaldi would get the ""first call"".
Fittipaldi stood in for Romain Grosjean at the 2020 Sakhir and Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after the Frenchman’s fiery crash. 
“Haas F1 team has elected to terminate, with immediate effect, the title partnership of Uralkali, and the driver contract of Nikita Mazepin,"" the team said in a statement.
""As with the rest of the Formula One community, the team is shocked and saddened by the invasion of Ukraine and wishes for a swift and peaceful end to the conflict.”
Mazepin’s future was already looking uncertain after Haas removed branding for Uralkali, a Russian potash producer, from their car on the last day of the Barcelona test last week in the wake of Russia’s Feb 24 invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. 
Uralkali is owned by Mazepin’s Oligarch father, Dmitry, with the 23-year-old’s place at the team guaranteed by the sponsorship deal.
Mazepin made his debut last season in an all-rookie line-up with Schumacher.
The only Russian on the grid, he would have been allowed to race in a neutral capacity, according to a decision by the FIA’s World Motor Sport Council.
But his participation in individual races would have been in doubt, especially after Motorsport UK banned Russian and Belarusian licence holders from competing in the country, raising the prospect of other national motorsport federations doing the same.  
Haas finished at the bottom of the constructors’ standings last year and were the only team not to score a point after choosing to forgo development of their car to focus on their 2022 challenger designed to this year's drastically overhauled rules. 
But Mazepin’s performances were also underwhelming, with the Russian outperformed by team-mate Schumacher.
His ousting from Haas could mark the end of his career.
F1 on Thursday said it will no longer race in Russia after terminating its Russian Grand Prix contract, originally set to expire in 2025.
The sport had already called off its 2022 race in the country.

It retained its place in the 2021 and 2022 world championships.

The 29-year-old, who has 119 grand prix starts to his credit, raced with the Ferrari-powered team from 2017 to 2020 and will partner German Mick Schumacher, son of seven-times world champion Michael.
Mazepin's contract was terminated last week after Russia invaded Ukraine.
The season starts in Bahrain on March 20 after a final three-day test this week.
""When looking for a driver who could bring value to the team, not to mention a wealth of Formula One experience, Kevin was a straightforward decision for us,"" said team boss Guenther Steiner in a statement.
""Kevin’s immediate availability means we can tap into him as a resource for pre-season testing alongside both Mick Schumacher and (reserve) Pietro Fittipaldi.""
Brazilian Fittipaldi will do half a day in the car on Thursday before handing over to Magnussen and Schumacher.
Magnussen started out in Formula One with McLaren in 2014, finishing second on his debut in Australia.
He sat out 2015 as team reserve and raced for Renault in 2016 before switching to Haas where his best result was fifth place in Bahrain and Austria in 2018.
""I was obviously very surprised but equally very excited to receive the call,"" said the Dane.
""I was looking in a different direction regarding my commitments for 2022 but the opportunity to return to compete in Formula One, and with a team I know extremely well, was simply too appealing.""
Magnussen had been due to race for Peugeot in world endurance as well as U.S-based Chip Ganassi Racing in sportscars, and he thanked both for releasing him.
""I’ve been briefed as much as possible on the development of the VF-22 and the potential in the package. There’s work to do but I’m excited to be a part of it. I can’t wait to get back behind the wheel of a Formula One car in Bahrain,"" he said.
Mazepin and Schumacher had been an all-new line-up last season but failed to score any points as the team concentrated its resources on 2022 and radical new regulations aimed at making racing more competitive.
Haas ended up last in the standings.

The new cars have been designed to the biggest rules' overhaul in decades, aimed at making racing closer and more entertaining, but they hit problems when they ran in Barcelona last month.
In an unexpected effect of the changes, the cars were seen to bounce excessively - like the movement of a porpoise through water - at speed on the straights as they generated and then lost downforce.
Some teams have struggled with it more than others.
""It doesn't feel great especially when you think that we're doing 300kph and we are jumping 30-40mm up and down like crazy,"" said Ferrari's Carlos Sainz.
""Hopefully, it's resolved and it's not something that we need to live with because it's quite on the limit.""
Briton George Russell, gearing up for his first full season alongside seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes, said it could be a safety issue.
He said reintroducing banned active suspension, in which the car's settings are automatically altered corner-to-corner by pre-programmed software to maximise grip and performance around the lap, could offer a solution.
""I guess if active suspension was there, that could be solved with a click of your fingers,"" he said. ""But let's see in Bahrain. I'm sure all the teams will come up with some smart ideas around this issue.""
Ferrari, who did most mileage over the three days in Barcelona, impressed paddock observers with their pace and reliability.
McLaren, who went fastest with Lando Norris on the opening day, also looked strong.
Mercedes showed a glimpse of their potential, when Hamilton set the fastest time overall after a low-key opening two days for the constructors' champions.
World champion Max Verstappen was also fast in his Red Bull.
But testing form is notoriously difficult to read and teams are set to bring significant upgrades to Bahrain this week.
That means the test should provide a more conclusive guide to form.
""You know who is probably in the top half and you know who's in the bottom half,"" said Russell in Barcelona. ""Things will probably look very different with the development by the time we get to Bahrain.""

The U.S.-owned team missed the first half, or four hours, of the opening day of running at the Sakhir track after the aircraft ferrying their freight, including their car, was delayed by a technical issue.
The squad, who did manage to hit the track with Brazilian Pietro Fittipaldi after lunch, had hoped to make up for lost time by running for half a day on Sunday.
But that would have meant running on the day after the test's official Saturday end, which they were not permitted to do.
Instead, they can carry on running beyond the chequered flag on the three days of the test, which would mean longer hours for the team. 
""We were denied the testing on Sunday,"" said team boss Guenther Steiner.
""Everyday we can make up four hours of testing but we need to make it up at the end of the day.""
Steiner said Haas would have needed the unanimous backing of the other teams to have been allowed to run on Sunday.
McLaren, he added, had blocked their bid to run for an extra half-day.
""The regulation, it needs to be three days in a row and it needs to be just unanimously voted that we can do it.""
Haas have had a difficult few years, battling near the back of the pack.
They finished last overall in 2021 and were also the only outfit to not score a point.
More recently, they were caught up in the fallout of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and severed ties with Russian driver Nikita Mazepin and title sponsor Uralkali, owned by his oligarch father Dmitry, last week.
Both are on an EU sanctions blacklist.
When asked why they were the only team to have faced freight delays, Steiner joked:
""Because we’re unlucky.
""It was just the wrong plane at the wrong time,"" he added saying the plane had been chartered by the sport's commercial rights holder Formula One Management.
""The plane had some technical issues and it was stuck in Turkey, it never made it to the UK and that was it.""

Charles Leclerc, quickest for most of the day with his morning best of one minute, 34.531 seconds, was relegated to third by the late improvements for Gasly and Ferrari team mate Sainz.
Most of the attention on Thursday was focused on Mercedes after their W13 challenger turned up with dramatically narrower sidepods. 
But the advantage of what Formula One's motorsport managing director termed a ""very extreme interpretation"" of the new 2022 rules was not immediately evident with George Russell and Lewis Hamilton, who shared driving duties, ninth and 11th respectively.
Times in testing are notoriously difficult to read with teams all running their own individual programmes.
Red Bull logged the most mileage, with Mexican Sergio Perez, in the car the whole day, clocking an impressive 137 laps.
Russell and Hamilton logged a combined 121 laps for Mercedes while Alfa Romeo, who endured a difficult opening test in Barcelona last month, finally enjoyed a productive day of running with Valtteri Bottas and China's Guanyu Zhou clocking a total of 120 laps.
Ferrari, who impressed in Barcelona, continued to look strong, showing not only impressive pace but also chalking up 116 laps.
McLaren, strong in Barcelona, struggled on Thursday in Bahrain.
Lando Norris, who drove for the whole day after team mate Daniel Ricciardo felt unwell, was hampered by braking issues and managed a paltry 49 laps.
U.S.-owned Haas were forced to sit out the morning session after their air freight, including their car, arrived late due to a technical issue with the plane carrying it.
Brazilian reserve Pietro Fittipaldi nevertheless managed 47 laps during the post-lunch session.
Thursday's running was largely incident free.
It was halted twice, first to clear up debris and again in the closing minutes when Perez beached his Red Bull in the gravel.
Teams also reported a lower degree of ""porpoising"", a phenomenon in which cars bounce excessively at speed, than they experienced in Barcelona, but they still have not solved the issue.
The Bahrain test concludes on Saturday.
The island kingdom will host the season-opening race on March 20.

FERRARI HYPE
Ferrari have consistently shown strong pace and reliability, both at last month's first test in Barcelona and now in Bahrain, which will also host the season opener on March 20.
However, they have been quick to play down the hype.
Lap times in testing are notoriously difficult to read.
But, in addition to their raw pace, Ferrari's car has also looked the most assured and easiest to drive of all.
Red Bull are yet to show their hand, though, as are reigning champions Mercedes, who are still fettling their challenger after turning up in Bahrain with a bold new design featuring dramatically shrunken sidepods.
Friday's running was disrupted by four red flags.
Nicholas Latifi stopped with the brakes of his Williams on fire before lunch, ending the team's programme early.
Valtteri Bottas was responsible for the second stoppage in the closing stages of the morning session, brining his Alfa Romeo to a halt after completing a practice start.
Esteban Ocon parked up his Alpine as a precaution in the evening while Lando Norris brought out the fourth red flag of the day when he ground to a halt in his McLaren at the pit exit.

The sport's current cap is $140 million a year per team, with some items such as driver salaries not included, down from $145 million in 2021. It is due to drop to $135 million next season.
Horner told reporters during pre-season testing in Bahrain  that jobs could be at risk as tightly-controlled budgets were eroded.
Most of the teams are based in Britain, where inflation is set to reach its highest level since the early 1980s and energy prices have surged.
The biggest outfits, such as Red Bull, had to shed staff to meet last year's cap.
""What you have to remember is when the budget cap was set back in the midst of the pandemic, in the middle of 2020, nobody could have foreseen the circumstances that we have in the world today,"" Horner said.
""What we see going on in the world is only going to drive prices one way,"" he added, recognising also the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""Inflation looks like it could hit record amounts. We’re seeing that impact already on things like air freight just to this event.
""I think it’s a very serious problem that we have to look at and address because this has a one-to-one impact on people’s jobs and livelihoods.""
Formula One has a record 23 races this season, which starts in Bahrain next week, with rounds in the Americas, Asia and Australia as well as Europe and the Middle East.
""It's the duty of the regulator to look at this with a degree of urgency to make sure that the relief is put in place to take into account what's going on in the world with the cost of living increases that we're all going to see,"" said Horner.
McLaren, who pushed hard for an even lower cap to be imposed, recognised circumstances had changed.
""It's always important to apply common sense and with these additional challenges that came up in the last weeks and months in terms of inflation and so on ... I think it's important to simply have a discussion about it,"" said team boss Andreas Seidl.
""We are absolutely up for that discussion ... open also to solutions or potential adjustments as long as everything is happening within reason.""

The season begins in Bahrain next week and Hamilton, hoping to win back the title from Red Bull's Max Verstappen after a controversial end to the 2021 season, took the underdog position.
""At the moment, I'm sure everyone can figure that out, we are not the quickest,"" the 37-year-old Briton told reporters on the final day of pre-season testing at the Sakhir circuit.
""I think Ferrari look to be the quickest and perhaps Red Bull and then maybe us or McLaren. We're currently not at the top.""
Asked whether he had any concerns about his ability to fight for the championship, Hamilton said it was too early and expressed confidence in his team's proven ability to work through any problems.
Mercedes have won the last eight constructors' championships.
Hamilton said the new car had shown decent reliability and the team had got through their test programme but it was clear there remained much to do.
""At the moment I don't think we'll be competing for wins,"" he said.
""There is potential within our car to get us there, we've just got to learn to be able to extract it ... we have some hurdles to overcome.
""Next week we'll get a much better showing of our pace but I think people will be surprised, maybe. People keep talking about (whether) we're talking ourselves down or not but it's a bit different this year.""
Mercedes's rivals have taken such declarations with some scepticism in the past.
Last year Mercedes had a troubled pre-season, completing the fewest laps of any team, but Hamilton still won the opening race in Bahrain.
In 2019, Mercedes had looked up to half a second off Ferrari's pace in testing and then finished one-two in Melbourne.
This season has radically revised rules and Hamilton, the sport's most successful driver of all time with a record 103 wins, said it felt different.
""I think we have far bigger challenges this time,"" he said. ""It will take a little bit longer. From what I'm told, we have a considerable amount of pace to find.""

Ricciardo, who tested positive for COVID-19 on Friday, was forced to sit out the whole of the final Bahrain pre-season test which ended on Saturday.
Team boss Andreas Seidl, who told German publication Auto, Motor und Sport that Ricciardo would have to isolate until the evening of March 17, is confident the Australian will be fit to race in the March 18-20 season-opener in the island kingdom.
The team already have a reserve driver-sharing agreement with engine supplier Mercedes that allows them to use Stoffel Vandoorne or Nyck de Vries as substitutes, while Scot Paul di Resta is also on their books as a back-up. 
""In the spirit of offering maximum racing opportunities to our stable of young talent, we have agreed that McLaren may call upon... Oscar Piastri in the event one of their drivers is unable to race,"" Alpine said in a statement.
""Oscar will remain fully contracted to Alpine, and we will retain first options on his services,"" it added.
The statement did not specify how long Piastri would be on offer to McLaren as a reserve but the engagement is most likely for the entirety of the 2022 season.
Australian Piastri, 20, won the Formula Two title last year and is seen as a promising young talent.
He has been tipped as a future replacement for double world champion Fernando Alonso and Alpine have an exhaustive preparation programme planned for him this season.
He could gain crucial Formula One race experience next weekend if McLaren pick him as a replacement if Ricciardo is unable to race.
Di Resta, whose last F1 experience came as a stand-in for Felipe Massa at Williams in 2017, and Vandoorne, who raced for McLaren in 2017 and 2018 and now drives for Mercedes in the Formula E series, are scheduled to compete in the 1000 Miles of Sebring endurance race on the same weekend as the Bahrain Grand Prix.
That left De Vries as the only driver in the McLaren pool free to stand in for Ricciardo until Alpine's offer of Piastri.
Seidl, though, does not believe McLaren will need a replacement for Ricciardo, who heads into the season on the back foot having had only one-and-a-half days' experience of a car designed to radical new rules.
""I’m confident he will be fit again next weekend,"" said Seidl.
""He’s feeling better already but as we know it simply takes a few days until you are fully back in good shape.""

McLaren gave no details of the testing programme for the 21-year-old, who in 2019 became the U.S.-based series' youngest winner.

Andretti tried last year to take over Swiss-based Sauber, who run the Alfa Romeo team, and has said Herta would have been  one of the drivers had he been successful.
Herta said last month that he would not be able to pass up an opportunity to race in Formula One should the FIA approve Andretti's application.
McLaren also have an IndyCar team and chief executive Zak Brown, an American, has been supportive of Andretti's bid to enter Formula One.
The United States will have two grands prix this year, with Miami debuting in May and Austin, Texas, a fixture on the calendar. The sport is owned by U.S.-based Liberty Media who are keen to grow it in the Americas.
Formula One has not had a U.S. driver since Alexander Rossi, the 2016 Indianapolis 500 winner, in 2015.

261,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/city-tour-bus-better-preparation-f1-simulator-jokes-vettel-2560671,"City tour bus better preparation than F1 simulator, jokes Vettel","MANAMA :     Sebastian Vettel on Saturday joked that driving a city tour bus would prepare drivers better than any simulator for the challenge of wrestling their heavier 2022 Formula One cars around tight and twisting layouts like Monaco.
This season's cars have been designed for the most radical rules overhaul in decades, aimed at allowing drivers to follow each other closely in a bid to improve the racing spectacle.    
But with a larger proportion of downforce now generated from their undersides, the changes have resulted in cars that, while quick through high-speed corners, struggle into tighter turns.
Required to weigh at least 795 kg with the driver in the cockpit, a limit that is set to increase to 798 kg before the start of the season, they are bulky, which makes them even more awkward to navigate through sharp, slow turns. 
""Maybe it’s better to jump on the city bus rather than the simulator before the race to get the preparation done,"" Aston Martin's four-time world champion told reporters during Saturday's final day of pre-season testing in Bahrain.
""The cars now are different. The first thing that stands out is the weight, the cars are a lot heavier, it’s just more inertia, more mass, so therefore the driving has to adapt.""
The 2022 cars are also stiffly sprung and fitted with larger 18-inch wheels with thinner side walls that are not as good at smoothing out bumps as their 13-inch predecessors. 
As a result, and because of their revised aerodynamics, the cars were seen to be ""porpoising"" or bouncing excessively - like the movement of a porpoise through water - as they generated and then lost downforce at speed on the straights.
Teams have dialled this phenomenon out to a large degree but the cars at the end of pre-season testing were still giving drivers a bumpy ride.
""I’m pretty sure I can expect to have a sore back after Sunday’s race,"" said Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.
""On a full day of testing, you might need to take a bit of paracetamol in the afternoon...,"" joked Alpine's Esteban Ocon. 
Vettel said if the cars delivered on their promise to improve the racing spectacle, it would all be worth it.
""That will make up for the cars being a bit unpleasant when it comes to stiffness levels or the tyres maybe falling off or the cars generally being very, very heavy,"" he said.

The Gulf kingdom made its Formula One debut last year as part of a 15-year-deal with a night race in Jeddah in December. 
It is expected to move eventually to Qiddiya, a planned entertainment resort about an hour’s drive from the capital Riyadh, once a permanent circuit has been built.
Qiddiya is at the heart of an ambitious strategy to open the economy and ease social restrictions.
""I suspect that we will run the race there for another four years,"" Whitaker, who heads up the Saudi Motorsport Company, the promoter of the race, told a select group of journalists at last week's final pre-season test session in Bahrain.
""That would be my thinking ... purely because I think that gives us the necessary time to build Qiddiya.
""Formula One have made it very clear in their contract with Saudi that they don’t want to be running in Qiddiya when Qiddiya is effectively a building site. That makes perfect sense.
""Once Qiddiya is ready and ready to accommodate Formula One, then it will move."" 
The 6.1km Jeddah Corniche Circuit, a thrilling layout comprising mainly flat-out blasts along the city's Red Sea waterfront and a succession of high-speed corners hemmed in by walls, served up a thriller under the floodlights as host to the penultimate round of the season last year.
Whitaker's four-year timeframe includes the 2022 event, which has been scheduled for March 27 as the second round of the season this year - one week after neighbouring Bahrain's season-opener.
Whitaker said the race wanted to hold on to an early-season spot, even though being the penultimate round last year, as the title battle between Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen raged towards its conclusion, gave the event a high-profile debut.
""There's no doubt about it, being the penultimate race last year was fantastic,"" said Whitaker.
""But, to be honest, I think we've got to remember that Saudi Arabia is now one of 23 countries around the world that stages a Formula One race.
""Wherever you are on the championship calendar, you've got an opportunity to shine and to embrace what Formula One has to offer,"" he added.

New-look cars, heavier and with bigger wheels but re-drawn aerodynamics to make overtaking easier, have raised hopes of a general shake-up as part of the most far-reaching overhaul in decades.
Michael Masi, the race director whose decisions left Hamilton feeling robbed of a record eighth title in the Abu Dhabi showdown last December, has gone, while Mohammed Ben Sulayem has replaced Jean Todt as head of the governing FIA.
While last year's title contenders will be renewing their fierce rivalry, the battle looks set to stretch beyond a private duel.
""I think there’s going to be a real mix of pecking order through the year in all likelihood. The development rate is going to be very aggressive,"" said McLaren technical director James Key.
""There’s a chance people will surprise, and people will be a little bit further back than expected in the first races.""
Champion Verstappen, 24, will start the season at Sakhir on Sunday with the number one on his Red Bull for the first time.
Hamilton meanwhile has a hungry new team mate in fellow Briton George Russell, arriving from Williams and eager for a first win.
Both drivers have already warned the fans not to expect too much, with the Mercedes bouncing on the straights as downforce is gained and lost.
The team, chasing a record-extending ninth successive constructors' title, and Hamilton can never be written off, however.
""If you think that what you saw at the end of the last year was my best, wait till you see this year,"" Hamilton said last month.
Red Bull and Verstappen have been pleased with their car's performance while highlighting a growing threat from Ferrari, climbing back into contention after years of under-performing.
The Italian team have not won a race since 2019 or a championship since 2008 but ending at least one of those two droughts no longer looks like a distant dream.
Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff spoke for many in hoping Ferrari do step up with Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz.
""As a fan, I love Ferrari. They are the greatest name in Formula One and it cannot be that Ferrari is not competing for race victories and titles,"" said the Austrian.
""Winning championships is something different, many things have to come together to achieve that, but I think for all of us fans of the sport Ferrari needs to be in the mix. We have missed them in the last few years.""
The calendar is set for a record 23 races, with Miami debuting in May as a second U.S. round but Russia cancelled as a result of the war in Ukraine and a replacement yet to be confirmed.
Russian driver Nikita Mazepin has had his contract terminated by U.S.-owned Haas, with experienced Dane Kevin Magnussen making a comeback alongside Mick Schumacher.
Thailand's Alex Albon, previously with Red Bull, is at Williams after a year away.
China is again absent from the calendar but has its first race driver in Alfa Romeo's Guanyu Zhou, the only rookie on the starting grid and team mate to Hamilton's former sidekick Valtteri Bottas.
Three sprint races are scheduled, but with points now extending to the top eight in Saturday's 100km dash.",['258_0'],"[""\nFILE PHOTO: Formula One F1 - Abu Dhabi Grand Prix - Yas Marina Circuit, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates - December 12, 2021 Red Bull's Max Verstappen celebrates winning the race and the world championship with the Netherlands flag on the podium as Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton looks dejected after finishing second REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed\n""]"
257,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/formula-one-faces-its-biggest-change-decades-2566581,Formula One faces its biggest change in decades ,"Formula One starts a new season in Bahrain on Sunday with the biggest technical rule change in decades leaving plenty of questions to be answered.
The cars, heavier and with bigger wheels, look very different to last year's models thanks to an overhaul aimed at making overtaking easier and the racing more competitive and exciting.
There is plenty of debate already about the spirit of the rules, to what extent the changes will be successful, how teams have read them and whether some have pushed boundaries too far.
""This is by far the biggest change in regulation I think the sport has ever seen,"" commented Aston Martin technical head Andrew Green. ""My career goes back to 1991 and it trumps anything from 1991.
""I think it trumps everything as far as F1 is concerned,"" he added.
""It’s a completely new concept, a completely different way of approaching a regulation. It’s been a massive challenge. It’s been exciting for sure.""
Formula One's managing director for motorsport Ross Brawn, another veteran whose career dates back to the 1970s and who has run teams and also served as a Ferrari technical director, hailed a real break with the past.
He said the aim was ""to get a closer competition going on for the future while still leaving it a meritocracy.
""I think there’ll be a bit of disparity at the beginning but I’m confident these rules and this regime and this culture will lead to much better racing.""
The most obvious changes are the increase in wheel size from 13 to 18 inches, with low profile Pirelli tyres, and new look front and rear wings designed to reduce the aerodynamic turbulence for cars following behind.
There are fairings on the front wheels and radically different interpretations of the sidepods, which are almost non-existent in the case of champions Mercedes, while the floors generate more ground-effect downforce.
""We may see that we don’t quite hit a bullseye in terms of following (cars) but we’ll still be so massively ahead of where we were, because the (old) cars were dreadful,"" said Brawn.
""We’ll still be a long way ahead of where the old cars are and then we’ll evolve it.""
The race weekend has also been condensed, with media activities moved to Friday from Thursday and more points for the three Saturday sprints to be held in Imola, Austria and Brazil.
Each team will also have to run young drivers in two Friday practice sessions over the course of the season.
The budget cap, now reduced to US$140 million, has introduced another strategic element.
""You have to decide extremely carefully where you invest your dollar in R&D. In the past it was a little bit easier because you could follow various avenues in chasing performance,"" said Mercedes boss Toto Wolff.
""Today you have to decide which one has the highest potential and then embark on it. So it’s a totally different way of operating for the big teams.""",['257_0'],"[""\nAston Martin's Sebastian Vettel during testing. (Photo: REUTERS/Albert Gea)\n""]"

The following, in 2021 championship order, looks at how the teams are shaping up (drivers given with racing numbers).
44-Lewis Hamilton (Britain), 63-George Russell (Britain)
Mercedes are chasing a record-extending ninth successive constructors' title, with Hamilton seeking to push his many records (103 wins and poles) into new territory after missing his eighth crown in a controversial end to 2021. Russell joins from Williams in place of Valtteri Bottas in an all-British lineup and hoping for a first F1 win. The W13 car has had problems with downforce on the straights but history has taught rivals to be wary of Mercedes claiming to be off the pace.
Prediction: Third at the moment but cannot be ruled out.
1-Max Verstappen (Netherlands), 11-Sergio Perez (Mexico)
The number one replaces 33 on Verstappen's car as the Dutch youngster starts as world champion for the first time. Red Bull set the pace in testing and looked pretty pleased with their car's trouble-free performance. Perez, hoping for a contract extension beyond 2022, is now well settled in and has an important team role to play.
Prediction: Early favourites, fighting for both titles.
16-Charles Leclerc (Monaco), 55-Carlos Sainz (Spain)
Ferrari have not won a race since Singapore in 2019 or a title since 2008 but long-suffering fans have plenty to be excited about, with the car looking well-balanced and quick in testing and rivals pointing to them as the team to beat. Sainz is no longer a newcomer at Maranello and the partnership with Leclerc is working well.
Prediction: Race winners, top two on current form.
3-Daniel Ricciardo (Australia), 4-Lando Norris (Britain)
Another settled line-up, with the experienced Ricciardo hoping for a much better season after a difficult first year at Woking despite leading a one-two at Monza. That was McLaren's first victory since 2012 and Norris will be hoping to add his name to the list of winners this year. The Mercedes-powered car is quick but was troubled by brake problems in testing while Ricciardo was sidelined by COVID-19.
Prediction: Fourth again, but looking for race wins.
14-Fernando Alonso (Spain), 31-Esteban Ocon (France)
Under new leadership, with principal Otmar Szafnauer moving from Aston Martin. Testing was mixed, troubled in Barcelona but with the car looking much more solid by the end in Bahrain. Double world champion Alonso, 40, is as committed as ever in a season likely to determine his future in F1 with highly-rated Australian reserve Oscar Piastri waiting in the wings.
Prediction: in danger of slipping back.
10-Pierre Gasly (France), 22-Yuki Tsunoda (Japan)
Honda have officially departed although the engine remains the same. Gasly, a race winner, is still the leader while Tsunoda should be more consistent after his rookie year. The car looked strong in testing.
Prediction: Targeting fifth, more likely to stay sixth
5-Sebastian Vettel (Germany), 18-Lance Stroll (Canada)
Luxembourger Mike Krack has taken over from Szafnauer as team principal at a Mercedes-powered team going through big changes, with a new factory being built and staff expansion. Seventh was a disappointment last year and a return to the top four is the target.
Prediction: Midfield battlers
6-Nicholas Latifi (Canada), 23-Alex Albon (Thailand)
The former champions pulled themselves off the bottom last year but the Mercedes-powered team remain something of an unknown quantity. Red Bull-backed Albon returns to the grid after a year racing in the German DTM series and with plenty of hunger. Latifi is now in his third season.
Prediction: In danger of slipping back.
77-Valtteri Bottas (Finland), 24-Guanyu Zhou (China)
Bottas, replacing retired compatriot Kimi Raikkonen, has a leadership role to play as he starts his post-Mercedes career alongside the only rookie driver on the grid, and first Chinese to start in F1. That will guarantee plenty of interest but points will still be hard to get, with reliability a concern even if the Ferrari-powered car appears fast.
Prediction: Ahead of Williams.
47-Mick Schumacher (Germany), 20-Kevin Magnussen (Denmark)
The only team not to score in 2021, Haas have made headlines already with the Russian invasion of Ukraine leading to a split from title sponsor Uralkali and Russian driver Nikita Mazepin. The return of Magnussen should raise morale as well as providing a benchmark for Schumacher in the German's second season. The Ferrari-engined car looks a lot better than last year's.

Following an investigation into potential salary cap breaches over five seasons from 2016 to 2021, Premiership leaders Leicester were penalised for undisclosed payments to players from a third-party company via image rights companies.
Leicester are 12 points clear at the top of the Premiership ahead of Saracens, who were docked 70 points and fined 5.3 million pounds in January 2020 for salary cap breaches, leading to their relegation from the top flight.
""In each of the four seasons from 2016-17 to 2019-20, Leicester Tigers exceeded the salary cap by an amount below the 'Overrun' limit above which a formal charge may be brought for an alleged breach of the regulations,"" Premiership Rugby said in a statement.
""The club has accepted the findings, which means there will be no further disciplinary process or appeal. The level of fine imposed in these circumstances, known as an Overrun Tax, is calculated by a formula set out in the regulations.""

The Silverstone-based team, who are constructing a new factory and expanding their staff, last month announced a long-term partnership with the Saudi state-owned energy giant.
""We're quite serious,"" Canadian billionaire Stroll told Reuters in a video call when asked about the possibility of Aston using their own engine when the rules change in four years' time.
""Aramco and I are discussing doing our own production engine for '26, the rules do change ... so we have a team of people currently studying the opportunity.""
Formula One's governing body has said the 1.6 litre V6 engine will remain but with more electrical power and without the MGU-H component which generates energy from heat. There will also be a power unit cost cap.
The FIA also wants to make it possible for new engine manufacturers to join the sport at a competitive level.
Aston Martin, seventh overall last season, currently use Mercedes units.
Mercedes, Renault, Ferrari and Red Bull (with Honda's intellectual property) are Formula One's engine makers with other teams supplied as customers.
The Volkswagen Group, with its Audi and Porsche brands, are also considering entering.
Technical head Andrew Green told reporters last month that it was normal to explore all possibilities.
""With our ambitions, we’re definitely investigating our power unit supply in the long-term,"" he said.

Russell, 24, has replaced Finland's Valtteri Bottas as team mate to seven times world champion Hamilton, 37, with the pair in equal machinery.
Asked what advice he would give to the youngster, Hill told reporters: ""Just make sure you're fast.
""You're going to have to be possibly faster than you've ever driven before,"" added the 61-year-old, an F1 expert for Sky Sports television, ahead of this weekend's opening race in Bahrain. ""It is a big step.""
Russell nearly won in Bahrain in December 2020 when he stood in after Hamilton was sidelined by COVID-19. He led but his efforts were wrecked by a team pitstop bungle and then a  puncture.
Hamilton is the most successful Formula One driver of all time, holding most of the major records including 103 wins and pole positions.
Hill said Russell, after three seasons at Williams and much longer as a contracted Mercedes driver, would need to make a strong start.
'It's what happens if you find it harder to match your team mate over a long period of time and you start getting questions,"" he said.
""You don't want to be getting those questions (from the media) halfway through the season: ""Was it harder than you thought? Is Lewis quicker than you thought? Do you think you can go any faster?""
""Those are the things. I am sure he will be keen to avoid that.""
Mercedes looked off the pace in Bahrain testing, their car  bouncing on the straights and losing downforce and precious time.
Both Russell and Hamilton have pointed to Red Bull and Ferrari as the form teams and warned fans not to expect a winning start.
Hill doubted Hamilton would be feeling any more stress than in last season's ultimately losing battle with Red Bull's Max Verstappen, a duel that ended in huge controversy on the last lap of the final race and the Dutch driver crowned as champion.
""I'm just wondering if this not getting it (last year) in a way has kind of relieved him of that pressure,"" he said of Hamilton. 
""He has got seven world titles and more race victories and pole positions than anybody else.
""If he gets the eight, fantastic. That would just be beyond, you don't need any further proof. If he doesn't get the eight, he's had a fantastic career to look back on. By any standards it's remarkable.""

The 22-year-old is racing for Ferrari-powered Alfa Romeo in an all-new lineup with Valtteri Bottas, the Finn who was team mate to seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes last year.
""From my side to become the first Chinese driver is something I dreamed of,"" Zhou told Reuters.
""I think our country’s motorsport fans dreamed of having one countryman represent them and it’s my goal I have been working over the years for that.""
Chinese drivers have tested Formula One machinery before with Ma Qing Hua and Dutch-born Ho-Pin Tung, who was reserve  for Renault in 2010 in another first.
Zhou, who was part of Renault-owned Alpine’s driver academy and finished third last year in feeder series Formula Two, fell in love with the sport when China hosted a grand prix for the first time in 2004.
""There’s plenty of eyes (that) will be watching, plenty of people will be supporting,"" he said.
""But of course from my side there will be plenty of pressure as well.""
China, with its rapidly emerging middle class and lure as an attractive market for automakers, is a key market for Formula One. 
The country's race will be absent for the third year in a row this season due to the COVID-19 pandemic but Formula One has  extended its contract with the Shanghai circuit until 2025.
There has also long been talk of a second race in the country. 
Zhou has been able to secure backing but, as a trailblazer for a country relatively lacking in motorsport culture, it has not been the easiest of journeys.
""I think overall if we don’t have a leader, it’s always difficult,"" he said.
""We (China) have not a lot of background and not a lot of manufacturers involved in Formula One.""
Being the first Chinese driver in F1 is one thing but Zhou wants to score points and, eventually, race in front of his home fans.
""Hopefully, one day I’ll be having a home crowd,"" he said.  ""That’ll be crazy.""

""Sebastian Vettel has tested positive for COVID-19 and will not therefore be taking part in the 2022 Bahrain Grand Prix,"" the team said in a statement.
Hulkenberg will replace Vettel alongside Lance Stroll from Friday’s opening practice session. 
The German is the team's reserve driver and has stood in for them three times since he last raced full time in F1 with Renault in 2019.
The 34-year-old replaced Mexican Sergio Perez twice and Canadian Stroll once in 2020 when the Silverstone-based team competed as Racing Point, with both drivers testing positive for COVID-19.
His last race was the 2020 Eifel Grand Prix at the Nuerburgring, when he replaced Stroll.
The 2015 Le Mans 24 Hours winner has started 179 Formula One grands prix, without standing on the podium, a record for most starts without a top-three finish.
Sunday's race is the start of a new era for Formula One, with cars designed to radically overhauled aerodynamic rules.
Vettel is the second driver to test positive for COVID-19 this month, with McLaren's Australian Daniel Ricciardo returning to the paddock on Thursday after a period of isolation. 
Formula One has relaxed its previously tight COVID-19 protocols this season.
Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, who has twice contracted COVID-19, said it was important to remain careful.
""We need to be cautious between drivers and all of these things because COVID has not disappeared from one day to the other,"" said the Monegasque.
""And if you have COVID, you cannot race, so it’s very costly.""
His team mate Carlos Sainz said he was trying to stay disciplined with protocols, especially as he might have the chance to fight for big results if Ferrari deliver on their pre-season promise.
""I just hope we can get back to normality as soon as possible because, it might be a bit controversial, but I think that we need to kind of move on a bit and get on with life.” 
The Saudi Arabian Grand Prix in Jeddah follows on from Bahrain next week and there was no word from Aston Martin about plans for that race.

The Dutchman, who clinched his first title at a controversial Abu Dhabi Grand Prix last December, was fastest in pre-season testing last week at the same Sakhir circuit that hosts the floodlit opener.
Verstappen will want also to do better than last year in Bahrain when he started on pole position but finished second after being forced to give up the lead to Mercedes rival Lewis Hamilton for going off track to overtake.
""I’m very excited to turn our attention to racing now, it’s a whole new era for the sport and anything can happen,"" said the 24-year-old.
""The car looks good and as a team we are in a good place.""
Formula One has undergone its most radical rules overhaul in decades with new-look cars designed to create better racing and several teams eyeing an opportunity to upset the established order.
Ferrari in particular seem set to end a winless streak dating back to the 2019 Singapore Grand Prix but drivers Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz have been keen to play down their car's potential.
""I feel we are still a bit behind Red Bull,"" said Leclerc. 
""I don’t think we are speaking about a (gap of a) second like last year or even more the year before, so I feel it is going to be closer for sure and this is already a good sign.""
Mercedes, who are tied with Ferrari as the most successful team at Sakhir having won there six times, are chasing a fourth consecutive win at the venue.
However, the team, beaten in Bahrain only twice since 2014, struggled to get their car dialled into the track's layout during testing, suffering more than others with bouncing on the straight. 
Hunting for a ninth consecutive constructors’ crown, and with Lewis Hamilton now alongside youngster George Russell as the sport's most successful driver chases the eighth title he felt robbed of last year, Mercedes cannot be written off.
""It’s a clean slate for everyone and all to play for,” said team boss Toto Wolff. ""I’m excited to see what the weekend has in store.""
The season-opening weekend will also see the return of experienced Dane Kevin Magnussen at Haas as a replacement for sacked Russian Nikita Mazepin.

246,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/seven-times-champion-bristow-feels-hamiltons-hurt-and-hunger-2572001,Seven times champion Bristow feels Hamilton's hurt and hunger,"LONDON :     As a seven times world champion chasing an eighth title after  losing out in the final round of last season, Emma Bristow knows something of the hurt and hunger felt by fellow Briton Lewis Hamilton.
The motorcycle trials rider may be an unfamiliar face to Formula One's most successful driver, and indeed to most of her compatriots, but she is as hungry to win on two wheels as the Mercedes great on four.
""To not win last year, it hurts,"" the 31-year-old told Reuters on a visit to London to collect the Torrens Trophy awarded to her by the Royal Automobile Club in 2020 for outstanding skill in international motorcycling.
Bristow, who watched Formula One's controversial Abu Dhabi season-ender last December with her heart racing, said she was determined to come back from her own dark place stronger mentally and physically.
The first woman to win the Torrens trophy, and the first trials rider to be honoured, she rode her Sherco Factory Racing bike up the stairs of the exclusive Pall Mall private members' club and around the plushly carpeted central rotunda.
In 2020, Mercedes driver Hamilton had celebrated his seventh F1 title and Bristow won her seventh successive women's FIM Trial World Championship with six wins in six starts.
Last season it was Spain's Queen of Trials Laia Sanz, a Dakar Rally and Extreme E competitor, who returned to take a  14th title in a battle with Bristow that went down to the wire in Portugal.
Hamilton's bid for a record eighth ended when now-replaced race director Michel Masi changed the safety car procedure in a move that opened the way for Red Bull's Max Verstappen to become champion.
Bristow, also a double world SuperEnduro women's champion and 10 times British champion, is hoping Hamilton makes up for his defeat in a season that starts in Bahrain on Sunday.
""I’ve got an F1 team that you build on your computer, I’m doing that at the minute. I love watching the F1,"" she said.
""It's almost like I want him to win because when he wins, I win. And when I win, he wins. So we’re kind of rooting for Lewis this year.""
WIDER AUDIENCE
Trials events involve riding over an obstacle course, over boulders and through streams, while standing up on a lightweight bike without a seat. Penalties are incurred by touching the ground with the foot.
The Torrens committee openly recognised that Bristow's achievements in what is very much a niche sport in Britain had previously passed them by and hoped they might now reach a wider audience.
The rider, who has had to source rocks and boulders from quarries to build courses on the family farm in the flat lands of Lincolnshire, said hard work and sacrifice paid off.
""It can be a lonely sport when you’re out in the rain, training on your own. But you’ve got a goal and you know why you’re doing it and that’s what spurs you on,"" she said.
""From the outside looking in, it always looks easy if someone is dominating but there’s so much that goes on behind the scenes in any sport. 
""To get to the top and stay at the top is tough.""

The Mexican, who was the first to miss a grand prix due to the virus when he had to sit out two rounds in 2020, spoke after two drivers tested positive ahead of Sunday's Bahrain season-opener.
Aston Martin's Sebastian Vettel is isolating while McLaren's Daniel Ricciardo will race after an absence last week.
Formula One has relaxed its previous strict COVID protocols at races this year but Perez said the sport was still too restrictive.
""COVID has evolved so much you know that I think the best judge will be ourselves,"" he told reporters at the Sakhir circuit.
""We should leave it up to the drivers to decide. I think we all have raced once in our lives while feeling really bad, health-wise. We are the judges to say we can race the way we are at the moment or we can simply not.
""If the driver feels comfortable to race like that, I wouldn’t think it’s a problem. The world seems to have moved on from it.""
Alfa Romeo's Valtteri Bottas agreed that it should be the driver making the call providing there was no risk of further spread.
Others suggested drivers could carry out team briefings remotely but still race.
""I think there’s ways of being very cautious and responsible whilst having COVID and still competing,"" said Vettel's team mate Lance Stroll, who missed a race in 2020.
""I think there’s ways of isolating yourself, putting your helmet on in your room and minimising complete contact with everyone... I do think I could compete with it.""
Ferrari's Carlos Sainz said it would be hard to accept missing a race if a title was at stake and he felt perfectly well.
Danish driver Kevin Magnussen, making a comeback with Haas after they parted company with Russian driver Nikita Mazepin, said he was more worried about missing a race than getting COVID.
Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton said there was no way he could have competed in 2020 when he missed a round after winning his seventh championship.
""I was very, very sick. Even when I came back just on the tail-end of it I barely made it through the race,"" added the Briton.

The Frenchman lapped the 5.4-km Sakhir desert track in one minute, 34.193 seconds on a sunny but cool afternoon.
Ferrari pair Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz were second and third, the Italian team continuing to back up the hype that has them marked out as one of the favourites.
George Russell led Mercedes' charge in fourth with Lewis Hamilton seventh as the reigning champions, who struggled to dial their car into the Sakhir track during last week's pre-season test, made a low-key start to their bid to secure a ninth-straight constructors title.
Reigning world champion Max Verstappen, who ended last week's test with the fastest time, was fifth for Red Bull.
Friday afternoon's running was not representative of the conditions drivers will face in Saturday's qualifying and Sunday's race, which are scheduled to be floodlit dusk-to-night sessions.
Teams are also still coming to terms with the most radical rules overhaul in decades, featuring cars that have been drastically redesigned in a bid to improve the racing spectacle.

Valtteri Bottas did not set a time in his first practice session as an Alfa Romeo driver. The former Mercedes racer's engine was reported to be misfiring.
Friday afternoon's session was largely uneventful but for one red flag stoppage. The halt was caused by the sidepod cover on Esteban Ocon's Alpine coming loose and leaving debris across the track.

Mexican Sergio Perez was two-tenths of a second off his Red Bull team mate's benchmark in third.
Red Bull and Ferrari have been hyped up by rivals as the favourites going into Sunday's season-opener, which will usher in one of the most radical rules overhauls in F1 history aimed at improving the racing spectacle.
Mercedes, gunning for a record ninth successive constructors' crown, have, in comparison, struggled to squeeze the speed from their new challenger with Lewis Hamilton warning fans not to expect him to be in the fight for the win on Sunday.
The seven-times champion, the most successful driver at the Bahrain track with five wins, was only sixth, half a second off his Red Bull rival's pace.
New team mate George Russell was fourth 0.391 seconds off Verstappen's best.

PSG won the first leg of their last-16 tie 1-0 at home before losing 3-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu last week in the return leg, another remarkable failure after past meltdowns against Barcelona and Manchester United.
After Pochettino joined more than a year ago, they reached the Champions League semi-finals last season but lost the Ligue 1 title to Lille while showing a lack of character and playing style.
Pochettino, however, is still asking for time.
""We are competitive by nature. This kind of challenge is an exciting one to take on... To give the possibility to fight again for this (Champions League) title, it's exciting,"" the Argentine told a news conference on Saturday ahead of Sunday's Ligue 1 trip to Monaco.
""Beyond the sadness, to give PSG the possibility to fight to fulfil their objectives is always a great challenge. And yes, we feel capable of it. Afterwards, it's a question of exchanges. We will have to sit down with the club to exchange. To find the best formula. To see the vision, the future, the ideas, the project.""
Whether Pochettino will be the coach leading PSG to another bid for the Champions League title is anyone's guess, though, as speculation is mounting that he could be replaced at the end of the season.
""We will analyse everything at the end of the season,"" he said.
""We will see at the end of the season (if I stay). It will be the club's decision.""

The Australian allowed only the lapped cars between Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton to unlap themselves as he prepared to get the race restarted after a safety car period.
That gave the Dutchman the chance to pass Hamilton for the lead on the last lap which denied the Briton an unprecedented eighth title and sparked a backlash from fans.
""The process of identifying lapped cars has up until now been a manual one and human error lead to the fact that not all cars were allowed to unlap themselves,"" said the report, the result of an investigation into the events in Abu Dhabi, which was presented at the FIA's World Motor Sport Council ahead of the 2022 season-opening race in Bahrain.
In response, the FIA had developed software that will automatically inform lapped cars allowed to move back on to the lead lap that they may unlap themselves, the report said.
The wording of the regulations has also been clarified to say ""all"" lapped cars must unlap themselves, instead of ""any"" lapped cars that was previously in the rules.
The report also acknowledged that the rules governing a safety car restart were open to interpretation.
It said Masi was trying to allow for one final racing lap, in accordance with feedback from various stakeholders, including teams and drivers, expressing their preference for races ending under green flag conditions. 
""In combination with the objective to finish under green flag racing conditions applied throughout the 2021 season, the report finds that the race director was acting in good faith and to the best of his knowledge given the difficult circumstances,"" said the findings.
Masi was replaced as race director by Niels Wittich and Eduardo Freitas, who will alternate in the role, as part of an overhaul of the FIA's refereeing system unveiled last month.
It also included the setting up of a virtual race control centre similar to football's VAR.

""I think we just saw the result of everything that happened in the last seven, eight days,"" team boss Andreas Seidl told Sky Sports television.
""I think he was on the back foot from the beginning going into this weekend with missing out on the test last week, then he lost additional laps yesterday with the water leak that we had and therefore it was always a difficult challenge for him today.
""In addition, we just struggled really all weekend so far here with the pace of the car. I think also that’s a result from all the fire-fighting we’ve had to do in the seven or eight days.
""We simply have to accept it and move on.""
Ricciardo said he had felt comfortable with the car after testing in Barcelona, where McLaren looked quick, but Bahrain had been more of a challenge.
""It's been a bit of an uphill battle ... not too surprised but we've just got to try and move up from here,"" he said.
Team mate Lando Norris, who suffered brake problems in testing last week, qualified 13th.
The Briton said the difference between Barcelona and Bahrain was mostly down to the track characteristics.
""Barcelona is more biased towards medium and high speed and here is more biased towards slower speed corners and that’s where we’re struggling a lot,"" he said.
""There’s more weaknesses here for us and we’re already learning where those strengths and weaknesses are.""
Seidl said the competition, in Formula One's new era with a major rules revamp, was unbelievably tight but hoped McLaren could still score points on Sunday.

Spaniard Carlos Sainz missed out on handing Ferrari their first front-row lockout since the 2019 Mexican Grand Prix by just 0.006s and had to settle for third.
“It feels good, the last two years have been incredibly difficult for the team and we knew this year's rules would be an opportunity for us,” said Leclerc after taking his 10th career pole and second in Bahrain. 
“I am very happy today in a tricky qualifying session; I wasn't happy with my driving,” he added.

Verstappen, who clinched his first title at last year’s finale in Abu Dhabi, had gone fastest in the final practice session earlier on Saturday.
He could not hit the sweet spot with the balance when it mattered, however, but is confident he has a strong car for Sunday’s race.

World champion Max Verstappen, who several times went wheel-to-wheel with Leclerc in a battle for the lead, was on course for second but was forced to retire three laps from the end, with team mate Sergio Perez suffering the same fate shortly after, as Red Bull left Bahrain with nothing.
Red Bull's problems played into the hands of struggling Mercedes, with Lewis Hamilton snatching third and new team mate George Russell finishing a career-best fourth.
“Again, I keep repeating myself, but the past two years have been incredibly difficult for the team,"" said Leclerc, after ending a 45-race winless streak dating back to Singapore 2019 for the sport's most successful outfit.
""It was a huge opportunity for the team - we couldn't hope for better.""
Sunday’s win was the third of the 24-year-old Leclerc’s career.
He earned it by fending off a charging Verstappen after the first stops, with the pair swapping places over several laps, and later timing his restart after a safety car period to perfection.
It was also the Italian team’s seventh triumph at the Sakhir desert track and their first season-opening one-two since 2010, when Fernando Alonso led Felipe Massa to victory in Bahrain.
The result put Leclerc, who also set the fastest lap and was voted driver of the day by fans, in the overall lead of the drivers' standings.
Ferrari, who opened the 2017 and 2018 seasons with a win but have not won a championship since 2008, lead the constructors' standings ahead of Mercedes.
""Firstly, a big congratulations to Ferrari, happy to see them doing well again,"" said seven-times world Hamilton, who for much of the race was running a distant fifth.
""I think it was such a difficult race, we struggled throughout practice but we did the best we could,"" the 37-year-old Briton added.
F1 returnee Kevin Magnussen put Haas back in the points with a solid fifth-place finish.
The result put the team, who in 2021 finished last and were the only outfit to not score a point, third in the overall standings.
Valtteri Bottas was sixth in his first race for Alfa Romeo, ahead of Alpine's Esteban Ocon, who served a time penalty for pushing the Haas of Mick Schumacher into a spin.
Yuki Tsunoda was eighth for AlphaTauri ahead of Spanish double world champion Fernando Alonso.
Guanyu Zhou, who became the first Chinese driver to race in Formula One, scored the final point in tenth on his debut for Alfa Romeo.
Schumacher missed out on scoring his first points but still took home his best result so far in 11th.

Charles Leclerc's pole to flag victory, with fastest lap, was a first for the Maranello team since Singapore 2019 when four times world champion Sebastian Vettel led Leclerc in a one-two.
""Mamma Mia!"" exclaimed the Monaco driver after crossing the line to trigger wild celebrations and the sound of the Italian anthem.
While Leclerc became the first from the Mediterranean principality to lead the championship, Spanish team mate Carlos Sainz made sure the team secured maximum points from the evening.
""Ferrari is back and it’s properly back, with a one-two and where the team should have been the last two years,"" said Sainz, who passed world champion Max Verstappen's stricken Red Bull before it retired.
""The hard work is paying off and we are there.""
Ferrari have not won a title since 2008 and slumped to a 40-year low of sixth overall in 2020 before moving back up to third last season.
""A big, big congratulation to Ferrari,"" said Mercedes' seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton, who joined the pair on the podium.
""So happy to see them doing well again. They are such an historic, epic team. It's great to see Carlos and Charles up there as well.""
A delighted Leclerc, who was also voted 'Driver of the Day' by fans, said the team could not have hoped for a better day.
""The last two years have been incredibly difficult for the team and we know this was going to be a big opportunity,"" he said after his third career win.
""Now it's starting in the best way possible ... we couldn't hope for better. It's incredible to be back at the top.""
Team boss Mattia Binotto said the one-two was a relief, and a big boost, but also an unexpected outcome on a day that ended in a nightmare for Red Bull with Sergio Perez also failing to see the chequered flag.
Verstappen had challenged Leclerc for the lead while Perez was heading for the podium before mechanical issues sidelined both.
Binotto - in one of the hottest of hot seats in world sport - said the closing stages of the race, with a safety car deployment 10 laps from the end, had almost given him a heart attack on the pit wall.","['234_0', '234_1']","[""\n      Formula One F1 - Bahrain Grand Prix - Bahrain International Circuit, Sakhir, Bahrain - March 20, 2022 Ferrari's Charles Leclerc celebrates on the podium after winning the race with second place Ferrari's Carlos Sainz Jr. REUTERS/Thaier Al-Sudani\n    "", ""\n      Formula One F1 - Bahrain Grand Prix - Bahrain International Circuit, Sakhir, Bahrain - March 20, 2022 Ferrari's Charles Leclerc celebrates on the podium after winning the race with second place Ferrari's Carlos Sainz Jr. REUTERS/Thaier Al-Sudani\n    ""]"

The Dutch driver took the fight to Ferrari's eventual race winner Charles Leclerc early on but his hopes died when he retired from second place three laps from the end.
Mexican team mate Sergio Perez also failed to make it to the chequered flag.
Team boss Christian Horner said it had been a ""brutal finish"" and the double retirement was the team's ""worst nightmare"".
Verstappen explained his car's brakes were overheating early on and then there was a problem with its balance and steering before what finally appeared to be a fuel system issue.
""It was just almost impossible to steer and the faster I was going, it felt also like there was a delay,"" he told Sky Sports television. ""So every time I was turning right it took a while before something was happening.
""It was very hard out there, a lot of different issues we had to deal with.""
The 24-year-old, who suffered two retirements last season on his way to the title, said the performance was in the car but he had not been able to really show what it could do.
""We already lost a lot of points again in one race weekend so that's really not good. Of course I know that with one retirement it's not over but I would have preferred to have at last 18 points,"" he added.
Horner said it looked like both cars had suffered a similar issue at the end, while Verstappen's steering problem stemmed from the car being dropped at a pitstop.
""The negatives are zero points, that's a brutal start. The positives are we've got a great car, we've got a car that's qualified on the front row and that's fought with Charles for the win,"" he said.
""We've got to get this behind us and get stuck into the next event.""

""This is really the best result we could have got,"" said the Briton after a season-opening race that looked sure to be a struggle after he started fifth behind the Ferraris and Red Bulls.
The retirement of Red Bull's world champion Max Verstappen and team mate Sergio Perez provided a surprise 183rd career podium for Hamilton behind the Ferrari one-two of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz.
Champions Mercedes have started the sport's new era on the back foot, Hamilton and team mate George Russell wrestling with a bouncing car and warning fans that rivals were clearly quicker.
""I woke up this morning hoping - super, super hoping - that we would have a chance to fight, have a car that’s better than we think or something like that but we did struggle in the race,"" said Hamilton.
The 37-year-old had qualified some seven-tenths of a second off Leclerc's pole time and looked set to stay fifth until the Red Bull pair were removed from the reckoning.
""Whilst we're currently not necessarily performance-wise fighting with these guys, this is not damage limitations but just a really, really great result,"" said Hamilton, winner of the previous three Bahrain Grands Prix.
""Of course we were fortunate but ultimately we've done a better job, we have better reliability.""
Team boss Toto Wolff said putting both drivers on hard tyres had been a wrong move like putting a ""hand down the toilet"" but the end result was ""fantastic"" for a team chasing a ninth successive constructors' championship.
""If we would have come in last year third and fourth it would have been very frustrating but this year I think we are punching above our weight class,"" said the Austrian.",['232_0'],"[""\nMercedes' Lewis Hamilton after the Bahrain Grand Prix. (Photo: Reuters/Hamad I Mohammed)\n""]"
231,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/comeback-kings-haas-return-form-bahrain-2576346,Comeback kings Haas return to form in Bahrain,"MANAMA: Haas boss Guenther Steiner said the US-owned Formula One team's return to form in the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix could not have been scripted any better.
Kevin Magnussen finished fifth for the team at the Sakhir desert track on Sunday.
The result was the outfit's highest finish since the Austrian Grand Prix in 2018, their best season in F1 yet.
It took them from last in the final standings of 2021 to third after this season's opening weekend, behind only powerhouses Ferrari and Mercedes.
""If you think about the last two years and then coming back like this, you cannot write a story like this,"" Steiner told Sky Sports F1.     
""The guys on the racetrack the last two years, they had tough times but kept their head low. We can all be very proud. I’m proud of them.
""It’s just fantastic,"" he added.
Haas have endured a tough time over the last few years. They ended last season as the only team not to score a point.
More recently, they were caught up in the fallout of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and were forced to sever ties with Russian racer Nikita Mazepin and his oligarch father’s potash-producing title sponsor Uralkali.
They then lost half a day's running at the final pre-season test in Bahrain due to freight delays after the aircraft carrying their cargo, including their car, hit a technical snag.
But the performance of their 2022 car, into which the team had ploughed all of their resources, appears to have handed them the break they needed.   
""Things happen in life,"" said Steiner.
""A month ago it was a completely different scenario and now all of a sudden we are fifth.""
Magnussen, who joined the team in 2017 but was replaced for 2021 along with team mate Romain Grosjean in favour of an all-rookie line up of Mazepin and Mick Schumacher, was re-hired on the eve of the season to replace the sacked Russian.
""It's so good to be back in this position,"" said the 29-year-old, who endured a two seasons of struggle in 2019 and 2020 with the team.
""It was just a different story to in the past."" 
Schumacher only just missed out on making it a double points finish for the team, although his 11th-place finish was a career best result for the son of seven time world champion Michael.
""From here on I think he’s hungry for points as well,"" Steiner said.","['231_0', '231_1']","[""\n      Formula One F1 - Bahrain Grand Prix - Bahrain International Circuit, Sakhir, Bahrain - March 20, 2022 Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton and Haas' Kevin Magnussen in action during the race REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed\n    "", ""\n      Formula One F1 - Bahrain Grand Prix - Bahrain International Circuit, Sakhir, Bahrain - March 20, 2022 Haas' Kevin Magnussen is seen before the race Pool via REUTERS/Giuseppe Cacace\n    ""]"

The floodlit race around the Sakhir desert track saw a reshuffling of the top order with resurgent Ferrari setting the benchmark and once-dominant Mercedes struggling.
There was also a thrilling wheel-to-wheel battle for the lead between Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Red Bull's world champion Max Verstappen.
The aim of the new rules, which feature redesigned cars with cleaner, sleeker aerodynamics and larger, 18-inch (45.7-cm)wheels, is to spice up the racing action by allowing drivers to follow closely behind each other.
Brawn said that on the evidence of the first race, they appeared to have delivered, with plenty of chopping and changing throughout the field.
""I can remember some pretty tedious first races,"" the Briton told reporters after Leclerc led team mate Carlos Sainz to Ferrari's first season-opening one-two since 2010. ""We didn’t get that today. I’m pretty pleased.
""I think when you watch the cars racing, you can see they can race.""
In addition to the design rules, Formula One has introduced a tighter, $140-million budget cap with that set to narrow to $135 million in 2023.
It also has a new governance structure in place that requires only a 'super majority' instead of unanimity to push through any last-minute changes, meaning any big breakthrough discovered by a team can be vetoed by rivals.
""No-one out there at the moment is going to be able to put another $100 million into a programme to solve their problems,"" said Brawn. ""So no-one’s going to pull away.
""I think there’s a lot of things that have come together that we can look forward to in a great year.""
Brawn warned against getting carried away by the successful debut of the new rules, however.
He said the 2022 cars were just a starting point and that work to make them even better at racing each other had to continue.
Formula One chief executive Stefano Domenicali agreed.
""We need to do the step-by-step but, for sure, the first signals are really encouraging,"" said the Italian.
""Formula One in this moment is undoubtedly in a great shape."" ","['230_0', '230_1']","[""\n      Formula One F1 - Bahrain Grand Prix - Bahrain International Circuit, Sakhir, Bahrain - March 20, 2022 Ferrari's Carlos Sainz Jr. in action during the race REUTERS/Thaier Al-Sudani\n    "", '\n      Formula One - F1 - Chinese Grand Prix - Shanghai, China - 6/4/17 - Formula One Managing Director of Motorsports Ross Brawn walks at the Shanghai International Circuit ahead of the Chinese F1 Grand Prix.

Speaking in a Q&A ahead of this weekend's Saudi Formula One Grand Prix in Jeddah, he said the kingdom was already the home of motorsport in the region with all-electric Formula E championship and Dakar Rally as well as Extreme E.
""We now host three FIA World Championship events and are looking at more in the future,"" he said.
""There is an ambition to expand and develop the motorsport we host and one we are considering in due course is MotoGP.
""I know that it will require a different type of racetrack to Jeddah, one which has a special specification for bikes, but with our new motorsport and entertainment city currently under construction in Qiddiya, it is something that will be considered for the future.""
MotoGP has raced in Qatar since 2004 and that floodlit night grand prix race is currently the only Middle Eastern round on the calendar.
Saudi Arabia made its Formula One debut last December as part of a 15-year-deal.
It is expected to move eventually to Qiddiya, about an hour’s drive from the capital Riyadh, once a permanent circuit has been built.
The prince said ticket sales for this year's race were strong, with much greater demand from international fans.
""Like many promoters we have seen the impact of the ‘Max Factor’ and we’ve had a lot of interest from Dutch fans who want to purchase tickets and support their hero Max Verstappen wherever he races in the world,"" he said.
Red Bull's Verstappen won last year's title after a season-long battle with Mercedes' seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton. Verstappen retired from last Sunday's opener in Bahrain.

The 40-year-old Spaniard returned to Formula One last year with the British-based team who, as Renault, took him to his titles in 2005 and 2006 and are hoping to challenge for wins again.
""The rules are meant to have a closer competition and a more fair competition as well with the budget cap, so it's up to us,"" Alonso told Reuters. 
""If we are fast, it’s because we did a good job. If we are not fast it’s not because we spend less or these things that happen in the past in Formula One.""
Alpine started the season in Bahrain last weekend with both cars in the points, Esteban Ocon taking seventh place and Alonso ninth.
""The cars now are very new for everybody,"" said Alonso.    ""During the year, I think it’s going to be a huge progress for everyone and we need to win that race also off track.""
The 2022 cars have been drastically redesigned with the aim of making overtaking easier and racing closer while the budget cap has been lowered to $140 million.
Lower ranked teams have had more aerodynamic development time than front-running rivals who can no longer spend their way to improved performance.
In Bahrain, a resurgent Ferrari finished one-two with once-dominant Mercedes struggling and world champion Max Verstappen's Red Bull failing to score.
Alpine finished fifth in the overall standings last year and won with Ocon in Hungary. 
The team, who have hired Otmar Szafnauer as team principal from rivals Aston Martin, have set a 100-race target to become championship contenders.
Alonso, yet to decide whether he will stay beyond this year, said the team's progress would be important.
""We are here to make those possibilities as soon as possible and try to shortcut that time in a way,"" said Alonso. 
""Everyone is working flat out in the car, in the engine side as well and we want to see Alpine win as soon as possible.""

But his car expired three laps from the end with Mexican team mate Sergio Perez following him into retirement on the final lap.
Red Bull identified a fuel system problem as the cause but have not given details about an issue that handed them their first double non-finish (DNF) since their home 2020 season-opening Austrian Grand Prix.

Verstappen will also want to banish the memory of last year's race around Jeddah's fast and unforgiving street circuit.

Hamilton is unlikely to be caught in such a tussle this year, however, with once-dominant Mercedes still wrestling with 2022's rules overhaul.
The constructors' champions were only third fastest in Bahrain behind Ferrari and Red Bull, although Hamilton still salvaged third thanks to the retirement of the Red Bulls.
""We know the W13 has potential,"" said Mercedes boss Toto Wolff.

The night race in Jeddah made its debut on the calendar last December.
The 27-turn Corniche circuit is the second longest on the calendar, some 800m shorter than Belgium's Spa, and the fastest street circuit. Track widening at the final turn 27 could make the lap even quicker.
The circuit runs along the shores of the Red Sea.
Three drivers led last year's race: Hamilton, Red Bull's Max Verstappen and Alpine's Esteban Ocon. 
RACE WINS
Hamilton has a record 103 career victories from 289 starts, the most recent being in Saudi Arabia last year.
Ferrari have won 239 races since 1950, McLaren 183, Mercedes 124, Williams 114 and Red Bull 75.
Ferrari ended a winless run of 45 races with victory in Bahrain last Sunday, their first since 2019.
POLE POSITION
Hamilton has a record 103 career poles, the most recent coming in Saudi Arabia last year.
POINTS
Kevin Magnussen scored more points (10) for Haas in Bahrain than the team had managed in the previous two seasons (three).
Valtter Bottas's sixth place for Alfa Romeo was that team's best result since 2019.
Neither Red Bull reached the finish in Bahrain, the first double retirement for the team since Austria in 2020.  
Hamilton is 15 points clear of Verstappen, a bigger margin than he enjoyed at any point last year. 
MILESTONE
Mercedes are chasing their 125th win in Formula One. 
Hamilton's third place in the Bahrain opener means the seven times world champion has stood on the podium in every season he has started since 2007 - 16 years in a row and a record for the sport, one more than Michael Schumacher managed.
Hamilton is the first driver to score points in 250 races. Schumacher, next on the list, scored in 221.
Jeddah will be Hamilton's 180th race for Mercedes, a record for a driver with a single team. 
Alfa Romeo's Guanyu Zhou became the first Chinese driver to race and score a point in Formula One. He is also the 66th rookie to score on his debut. 
Ferrari's Charles Leclerc is the first driver from Monaco to lead the championship.

Vettel missed last weekend's season opener in Bahrain after testing positive for the virus, with reserve driver and fellow-German Hulkenberg replacing him and finishing the race 17th.
Aston Martin said on Twitter that Vettel was expected to be fit for the Australian Grand Prix scheduled for April 8-10 in Melbourne.
""Nico coped well in Bahrain and we are sure he will do likewise in Jeddah,"" the team said.
Teams will be in action at the Corniche circuit in Jeddah later on Friday for the first two practice sessions ahead of Sunday's main race.
""After familiarising myself with the AMR22 in Bahrain last weekend, racing in Saudi Arabia will give me the opportunity to develop and further improve my understanding of the car,"" said Hulkenberg.
""The work I did back in the simulator earlier this week has given me some extra insight and helped me prepare for this fast and flowing track.
""Obviously, I wish Sebastian a speedy recovery, but I am really looking forward to the challenge and will be doing my best for the whole team this weekend.""
Sunday will be the fifth time Hulkenberg has stood in for the team since he last raced full time in F1 with Renault in 2019.
The 34-year-old replaced Mexican Sergio Perez twice and Canadian Lance Stroll once in 2020 when the Silverstone-based team competed as Racing Point, with both drivers testing positive for COVID-19.

The Monegasque driver, who was also fastest in the opening session of practice, during which a huge plume of black smoke rose over the Red Sea city, lapped the 6.1km Jeddah Corniche track in one minute 30.074 seconds under the floodlights.
Verstappen was second, 0.140 seconds slower than Leclerc with Carlos Sainz, who completed a one-two for Ferrari at last week's season-opener in Bahrain third.
Both Ferrari's ended their session early after touching the wall.
Events on the track were overshadowed by the attacks on the Saudi energy facilities owned by state-run energy giant Aramco, a major Formula One sponsor.
Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthis said they launched the attacks and the Saudi-led coalition said Aramco's petroleum products distribution station in Jeddah was hit, causing a fire in two tanks but no casualties. 
The second practice session was delayed by 15 minutes after Formula One CEO Stefano Domenicali called the drivers and teams into a meeting. 
Organisers said the weekend, with final practice and qualifying on Saturday and the race on Sunday, would go ahead as planned with fans in attendance. 
Formula One said it was closely monitoring the situation.
Once-dominant Mercedes, who have been caught out by F1's radical rules overhaul, made progress in the second session.
Lewis Hamilton, ninth in the first session, ended the day fifth. New team mate George Russell, 15th in the opening hour, was sixth.  
The first session was briefly halted when a corner distance marker came loose.
McLaren's Lando Norris clipped the board, showering debris across the track.
Friday's opening hour of practice also allowed drivers to familiarise themselves with the changes to the Jeddah track, a challenging layout made up mainly of blind, high-speed sweeps and flat-out blasts along the city's Red Sea waterfront.
Organisers have made changes to give drivers a better line of sight around the corners after safety concerns last year.

The Mercedes driver was asked at a news conference ahead of practice for Sunday's Saudi Grand Prix in Jeddah whether he had reservations about racing in the country, which debuted in F1 last year and has a long-term contract.
""It's mind-blowing to hear the stories,"" said the Briton.
Saudi Arabia said this month it had executed 81 men, including seven Yemenis and one Syrian, for terrorism and other offences, in the kingdom's biggest mass execution in decades.
Also this month, a Saudi Arabian court handed down a new death sentence against a young man for crimes committed when he was 14 years old after a higher court overturned a previous ruling. That man is now 17.
Lewis appeared to refer to that case, saying he had heard that he had been sent a letter from a 14-year-old on death row. ""At 14, you don't know what the hell you are doing in life,"" he said.
The Saudi government media office CIC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Saudi Arabia denies accusations of human rights abuses and says it protects its national security through its laws.
Saudi authorities had in 2020 scrapped the death penalty for juveniles and said they would apply this retroactively. The kingdom's state-backed Human Rights Commission later clarified that the ban on the death penalty only applied to a lesser category of offences under Islamic law known as ""ta'zeer.""
Hamilton said last December that he did not feel comfortable racing in Saudi Arabia and on Friday he said he felt the same.
""We don't decide where we go...(but) we are duty-bound to try and do what we can while we are here,"" he added.
""Ultimately it's the responsibility of those that are in power to really make the changes and we are not really seeing enough. So we need to see more.""
Saudi sports minister Prince Abdulaziz Bin Turki Al-Faisal said this week in a Q&A released by race organisers that the country was ""moving in the right direction"".
""We know there is work to do but it’s important that we continue to host major events like Formula One to help achieve a more inclusive, diverse and equal society,"" he said.
""We don’t mind the criticism if you at least acknowledge the focus and change we are making in the Kingdom.""
Daniel Ricciardo, who drives for McLaren, said Formula One could make a difference.
""I think by coming here we also have a chance to create some change or have some positive influence, as opposed to not coming here,"" said the Australian.
Some European parliamentarians this month expressed concern about ""sportswashing"" in Gulf countries and accused Formula One of double-standards in racing in Saudi Arabia while cancelling the Russian Grand Prix after Moscow invaded Ukraine last month.

The announcement came a day after the rebels attacked an oil depot located about 11km from the F1 circuit. The 20 drivers on the grid met several times Friday night in talks that stretched well past 2am to discuss safety concerns.
“Formula 1 and the (governing body) FIA can confirm that following discussions with all the teams and drivers, the 2022 FIA Formula 1 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix will continue as scheduled,” F1 said in a statement Saturday morning.
“Following the widely reported incident that took place in Jeddah on Friday, there has been extensive discussion between all stakeholders, the Saudi government authorities and security agencies who have given full and detailed assurances that the event is secure.”
F1 added that it has been agreed “with all stakeholders to maintain a clear and open dialogue throughout the event and for the future.”
There was a third and final practice session later Saturday scheduled to start at 5pm local time with qualifying set to start under floodlights at 8pm. 
The top three drivers speak to the media after qualifying and team principals were set for their media duties as scheduled in the early afternoon.
The Houthi rebels acknowledged the attacks on Friday evening and Saudi Arabia state TV called it a “hostile operation.” The Jiddah oil depot erupted in flames when attacked during Friday’s first practice session. It caused a raging fire that rattled the drivers enough to hold extraordinary talks regarding F1's presence in Saudi Arabia.
Many drivers expressed their concerns about racing in the region and Saudi Arabia’s human rights records when F1 ran its inaugural event at the circuit last December. Now back at the track a little over three months later, tensions are heightened amidst the attacks.
Conversations between drivers, team principals and F1 chief executive Stefano Domenicali late into Friday night centered on safety and security conditions.
Friday’s second practice was delayed 15 minutes because of an earlier driver meeting that included Mohammed Ben Sulayem, the newly-elected FIA president.
Race promoter Saudi Motorsport Company said earlier Friday that the weekend schedule had not been changed and a third practice and qualifying were still slated for Saturday. Drivers were only leaving the track mere hours before they were due to return.
The attack targeted the North Jiddah Bulk Plant, the same fuel depot the Houthis had attacked five days earlier. The plant is just southeast of the city’s international airport, a crucial hub for Muslim pilgrims heading to Mecca.
The plant stores diesel, gasoline and jet fuel for use in the kingdom’s second-largest city. It accounts for over a quarter of all of Saudi Arabia’s supplies and also supplies fuel crucial to running a regional desalination plant.
The Houthis have twice targeted the North Jiddah plant with cruise missiles. One attack came in November 2020. The second attack was Sunday as part of a wider barrage by the Houthis.
An Associated Press photojournalist covering Friday’s first practice saw smoke rising in the distance to the east, just after 5.40pm local time. As the flames rose, the tops of the tanks of the bulk plant were clearly visible.","['218_0', '218_1', '218_2']","['\n      steers his car during the Formula One Grand Prix it in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, Friday, March 25, 2022.

Drivers met for more than four hours at the Jeddah Corniche circuit at a gathering that stretched into early Saturday morning after Formula One and local organisers had already said the race would go ahead as planned, casting doubt on whether they would actually race.
They did not speak to the media after the meeting but team bosses confirmed the race was on.
""We went into long discussions between ourselves, with our team principals, and with the most senior people who run our sport,"" drivers body GPDA said in a statement.
""A large variety of opinions were shared and debated and, having listened not only to the Formula 1 powers but also to the Saudi government ministers who explained how security measures were being elevated to the maximum, the outcome was a resolution that we would practise and qualify today and race tomorrow."" 
Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthis on Friday said they launched attacks on Saudi energy facilities. The Saudi-led coalition fighting them said state-owned oil giant Aramco’s petroleum products distribution station was hit, causing a fire in two tanks but no casualties.
A huge plume of black smoke rose over Jeddah to the east of the track as cars went around the street circuit during Friday's first practice.
In their GPDA statement, drivers said seeing the smoke had made it difficult to remain fully focused as they tackled the blind, high-speed sweeps and flat-out stretches of the track located on the shores of the Red Sea.
""Perhaps it is hard to comprehend if you have never driven an F1 car on this fast and challenging Jeddah track, but on seeing the smoke from the incident it was difficult to remain a fully focused race driver and erase natural human concerns,"" they said.

The 23-year-old German's Haas team said that he would not participate in the season's second race despite being physically unhurt.
""There is a possibility that he’ll have to stay for observation overnight at the hospital. Based on these facts and where we are, we have decided not to field his car tomorrow,"" team boss Guenther Steiner told reporters.
The next round is in Melbourne, Australia, in two weeks' time.
On Saturday, Schumacher was taken by ambulance to the circuit medical centre after being extracted from the shattered car, which split in two when lifted onto a recovery truck, and then flown by helicopter to the King Fahad Armed Forces Hospital.
""He has no injuries which you can see, they just wanted to check on him and do some scans to see that there is no damage from the impact,"" Steiner told Sky Sports television.
He said that Schumacher, son of seven-time world champion Michael, had spoken to his mother, Corinna.
Commentators estimated that the car was travelling at 274kmh at the time of impact into the concrete barriers at the exit to turn 10, scattering debris across the asphalt.
The floodlit Corniche street circuit is one of the fastest tracks on the calendar.
It looked from television replays that Schumacher, who had been ninth fastest, lost control of the car on the kerbs, spinning and slamming sideways into the wall.
""Maybe he just tried a little bit too hard,"" said Steiner. ""Here if you make an error there's no run-off. It's walls.""
The crash was the second of the session, with Williams's Canadian driver Nicholas Latifi bringing out red flags in the first phase.
Steiner said that the car would have had to be completely rebuilt, and parts from the crashed one would have to be sent back to the factory for checks.

The 32-year-old Mexican produced the lap of his life to take the top slot for Red Bull in what will be his 215th grand prix start.
It also came on the 11th anniversary of his first qualifying session for Sauber on March 26, 2011 at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix.
Nobody else has ever waited so long for a pole, 'Checo' taking the record from Australian Mark Webber whose first, also with Red Bull, came at the 131st time of asking at the Nuerburgring in 2009.
""It took me a couple of races but what a lap,"" said Perez, whose team mate and reigning world champion Max Verstappen qualified fourth.
""I can do 1,000 laps and I don't think I can beat that lap. It was unbelievable.""
Team boss Christian Horner was every bit as delighted for a popular driver who also became the first Mexican to take a pole position in Formula One.
""I am just so, so pleased for Checo,"" he told Sky Sports television.
""He's working harder than ever and that lap was mighty. We could see it coming, and the Ferraris put down such a competitive marker. For Checo to go and do that, only the second time I think he's outqualified Max.
""And to put in a lap like that, here, at the hardest and most dangerous circuit that we go to, an unbelievable performance from him.
""Whatever he had for lunch, breakfast and dinner last night we're going to feed him the same, give him the same tomorrow. A phenomenal performance from him.""

The Houthi group on Friday said it had launched attacks on Saudi energy facilities.
One of the targets was a petroleum products distribution station owned by state-run oil giant Aramco located about 10km to the east of the track.
The strike, which followed similar attacks last Sunday, raised questions about whether the race should go ahead.
But F1 and local organisers said the grand prix would be held as planned.

""Of course, the security and safety for everyone is a bigger issue than just hosting a race, even if it is the size of Formula One, so the security of the city, the security of the kingdom is the top priority.""
Saudi state media on Saturday said fires at two storage tanks at the Jeddah facility, smoke from which was visible from the race track, had been extinguished.
The Houthi group has since said it was suspending missile and drone strikes for three days.
F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali said on Friday the sport had been given safety assurances.
The fact that senior Saudi figures and their families were at the track further underscored the security of the event, he added.
Drivers, who considered a boycott during a four-hour meeting, said in a statement on Saturday that authorities had assured them security was being ramped up to maximum.
But no details of the measures taken were given.
""I really don’t have any details, I am not one of the security agencies,"" said Prince Al-Faisal.
""...if I had I would share them and I’m sure they don’t share the details of these things because you know it’s going to go out.
""But for sure, there are communications between Formula One and our security agencies to ensure that everyone’s security is number one priority and we link that together with them.""
Formula One has a 15-year contract with Saudi Arabia, and the race is set to move to Qiddiya, a planned entertainment resort about an hour’s drive from capital Riyadh, in the future.
Drivers and team principals have called for discussions following Sunday's race.
""Whatever they want, we are here to host Formula One as best as it can anywhere in the world,"" said Prince Al-Faisal.
""So we will definitely have an open discussion with them to see what their feedback is to discuss with them and what their concerns are about, so we will show them everything.""

""We just had to play the long game, the tyres were wearing out quite quick.

Ferrari continue to lead the constructors' standings ahead of Mercedes with Red Bull vaulting up to third. 
Leclerc and Verstappen were running second and third after the start. 
Pole-sitter Sergio Perez appeared to have the race under control but an unfortunately-timed safety car, just after his pitstop, dropped him behind the Monegasque and his Red Bull team mate.
The Mexican lost another place when he was ordered to give up third position to Sainz, who had exited the pits alongside but slightly ahead of the 32-year-old under safety car conditions.
Leclerc established a comfortable lead over Verstappen as the race resumed and appeared set for a second straight win. 
But a virtual safety car in the closing laps brought the race to life.
Leclerc and Verstappen swapped the lead several times, as they both tried to be behind the other turning onto the long start-finish straight in an attempt to benefit from the top-speed boost of the Drag Reduction System (DRS).
Verstappen eventually won the game of ""DRS chicken"" and swept past his Ferrari rival on the 47th of 50 laps.

The 24-year-old, now third in the standings after the opening two races, said he played the long game to win a 50-lap battle with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.
""I'm really happy that we finally kick-started the season,"" said the Dutchman.
""Patience is always key,"" added the driver, who started fourth on the grid with team mate Sergio Perez on pole position and moved up when a safety car period played against the Mexican.
""Especially when you want to fight for the championship, you always fight hard, but of course keep in mind that you need to score points, so that’s what we did today.
""We raced hard but we also wanted to score the points.""
Verstappen was behind Leclerc in the final 10 laps at Jeddah's Corniche circuit but had a DRS (drag reduction) advantage down the straight.
There was little to separate the Red Bull and championship leaders Ferrari through the race, with the new 2022 regulations helping produce closer competition.
""We saw it in Bahrain, we saw it here. There seems to be so little to choose between the two of us,"" said Red Bull technical head Adrian Newey.
""I guess it's just going to be a big development war now, but a development war with one hand tied behind our backs because of the cost cap.
""Our season's finally got off the mark after the disappointment of last weekend so it's good to bounce back.""
Red Bull team boss Christian Horner said it had been a really tough battle with Ferrari, who also had Carlos Sainz finish third.
""They've got a great car, great drivers...if that's what we're set for for the rest of the season, it's going to be epic,"" added the Briton.
""We've got to keep winding the handle hard now because with such young, new regulations the steps are going to be big and fast and our opponents aren't going to stand still.
""We've got to get development coming through to this car.""",['209_0'],"[""\nRed Bull's Max Verstappen celebrates winning the race. (Photo REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed)\n""]"

The 24-year-old Briton finished fifth in a race won by Red Bull's world champion Max Verstappen, with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz also on the podium and the top two untroubled by anyone else.
Seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton, Russell's team mate, was 10th.
""That was the maximum today,"" said Russell, who is fourth in the championship after two races and six points ahead of Hamilton, of his performance under the floodlights.
""It was quite an enjoyable race considering I was all by myself throughout, pushing as hard as I could, I'd probably say the most physical race I've ever experienced in Formula One which was pretty cool.
""That's what it's all about, pushing hard on a mega circuit like this, high speed, but I want to be doing this for victories and not P5 all by myself.""
Russell - who has joined Mercedes after three seasons at tail-enders Williams - said the car had a good balance but  lacked grip on the fastest street circuit on the calendar.
He felt Mercedes were still roughly a second behind Red Bull and Ferrari.
""We're making baby steps at the moment, we need to make some bigger leaps,"" he added. ""I'm sure we can do that. The timeline, I don't know.""
Mercedes have won the last eight constructors' titles but the odds on them extending their record run of success, and of Hamilton securing an unprecedented eighth crown, are fading fast.

The sport's most successful driver with 103 wins, Hamilton was heard asking his engineer if his 10th-place finish offered any reward, as he found himself racing in unfamiliar territory on his return to the track at which he claimed his most recent win last December.
""Right now we’re not fighting for the top step as you know, we’re so far off the guys up ahead,"" he told reporters after driving in his 180th race for Mercedes, a new record for a driver with one constructor.  
""We’ve got a lot of work to do.    
""It’s gutting but we’ll keep working hard and keep fighting.""
Once dominant-Mercedes, who are still hoping to clinch a record extending ninth-straight constructors' title, have been wrong footed by Formula One's radical rules overhaul.
They are second behind a resurgent Ferrari in the overall standings.
But old rivals Red Bull, who drew a blank in Bahrain, are now just one point behind following world champion Max Verstappen's first win of the season at the Jeddah Corniche track on Sunday. 
Hamilton lined up 15th on the grid after failing even to make it past the first knockout phase of qualifying on Saturday for the first time since the Brazilian Grand Prix in 2017.
He progressed up the field on Sunday and ran as high as sixth behind team mate George Russell. 
Russell stayed fifth but Hamilton was unfortunate not to be able to pit under a late race virtual safety car (VSC). 
""The race was going relatively well on the hard tyre, was keeping up with George, putting in some decent times considering how old the tyres were,"" said Hamilton, who is fifth in the overall standings 29 points off Ferrari's championship leader Charles Leclerc after just two races.
""The strategy, I don’t know that or VSC, but we lost out so much.""
The Briton said he was looking forward to going home after a weekend that began with an attack by Yemen's Houthi group on an oil storage facility near the track.
""I'm so happy the weekend's done,"" he said.
""I'm also just so happy that everyone's safe, just looking forward to getting out.""

Mercedes' seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton finished 10th, the last of the points-paying positions, after failing to make it through the first phase of qualifying at Jeddah's Corniche street circuit.
Hamilton said that was 'gutting' while new team mate George Russell, fifth, said it was time for more than 'baby steps'.
Resurgent Ferrari lead the constructors' standings after two races, with Charles Leclerc top of the drivers' championship after leading a one-two win in Bahrain and taking second place in Saudi Arabia.
Red Bull's reigning champion Max Verstappen won on Sunday to open his account for a year shaping up as a battle between the teams from Milton Keynes and Maranello.
""We were right in the middle of those fun games in the front for the last eight years,"" Wolff told reporters in a video call after the race, recognising the new dynamic was good for the sport. 
""It is extremely painful to be not part of those fun games and by quite a chunk of lap time deficit.
""We're not going to rest until we are back in the mix. It's no fun at all. An exercise in humility and it's going to make us stronger in the end.""
Mercedes have been constructors' champions for the past eight years, a record run, but major aerodynamic rule changes this year have left them wrestling with a car that bounces, or 'porpoises', on the straights as downforce comes and goes.
They are 40 points behind Ferrari, and just one clear of Red Bull who are coming back from two retirements in the opening race. 
""We are not running the car where we wanted to run it and therefore it is very difficult to really assess what the lap time deficit is if we were able to run the car lower,"" said Wolff, adding that ""there are deficits everywhere.""

An attack on an oil storage facility near the track by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi group last Friday (Mar 25) cast doubt on Sunday's race, with drivers meeting for more than four hours to consider their stance.
The sport eventually decided collectively to carry on after receiving security assurances from Saudi authorities.
While Sunday served up a riveting floodlit spectacle around the thrilling Jeddah Corniche track, there was acknowledgement that Formula One needed to assess its newest fixture.
""I don't want to go too much into details on this subject now, but it's definitely a discussion that we should have after this race, once everything calms down,"" said Ferrari’s championship leader Charles Leclerc.
""I think after this weekend, all the drivers also together, we will speak with F1 and of course also the team bosses to see what's happening for the future,"" Red Bull's world champion and race winner Max Verstappen added.
Drivers also had reservations about the track, with its blind, high-speed sweeps and flat out straight stretches along the Red Sea.
Organisers made changes to, among other things, improve driver sight lines for this year’s race after the first last December.
But a heavy crash for Mick Schumacher’s Haas in qualifying underlined the perils.
""I think it's definitely the most dangerous place in the calendar,"" Red Bull’s Sergio Perez said shortly after taking his first career pole.
Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz added: ""When you see an accident like Mick’s (it) gives us a bit the tranquillity that even at those speeds the car is protecting you because the (governing) FIA has done a great job in giving us very safe cockpits. 
“But at the same time, is it really worth it?”
Saudi Arabia has signed a 15-year deal to host a race, with the fees contributing significantly to the bottom line for Formula One's owners Liberty Media.
The grand prix also reflects the Middle East’s growing profile and influence within the sport, with state-owned energy giant Aramco a major F1 sponsor and joint title partner of the Aston Martin team.
British supercar makers McLaren are majority-owned by Bahrain's sovereign investment fund Mumtalakat, with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) also providing significant funding.
Sunday’s event was the fifth in a row in the region which will again have four races on the calendar in 2023 when Qatar returns after hosting the football World Cup.
Neighbouring Bahrain played host to the official pre-season test and the season-opener on Mar 20.
Formula One argues, in the face of criticism from human rights groups, that it can act as a force for change in the region.
""Does Saudi Arabia and some of the other Middle Eastern countries share the same values and culture as we do in Europe? They don’t,"" said Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff.
""Can we by coming here put the spotlight into this place ... therefore making it a better place? I still think so.”","['204_0', '204_1']","['\n      FILE PHOTO: Formula One F1- Saudi Arabian Grand Prix - Jeddah Corniche Circuit, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia - December 5, 2021 General view at the start of the race REUTERS/Ahmed Yosri/File Photo\n    ', ""\n      FILE PHOTO: Formula One F1- Saudi Arabian Grand Prix - Jeddah Corniche Circuit, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia - December 3, 2021 General view of Haas' Nikita Mazepin during practice REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed/File Photo\n    ""]"

The season's first two floodlit races in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have seen Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Red Bull's Verstappen - both 24 - go wheel-to-wheel with one victory apiece.
The pair, established stars of the youth wave coming through who were just kids when Mercedes' Hamilton made his F1 debut in 2007, have been rivals since their formative years in go-karts.
""They were fighting when they were kids and now here for the first position in F1. It's very good for F1, a fantastic start to the season,"" enthused Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto on Sunday night.
Leclerc leads the standings, ahead of 27-year-old team mate Carlos Sainz, with Verstappen third and George Russell, another 24-year-old, fourth for Mercedes. Hamilton, 37, is fifth.
The sport has undergone a rules revolution, in the hope of making racing closer and more exciting, and Red Bull boss Christian Horner said the evidence was there to see.
""In the last two races we've seen Charles and Max pass each other about 10 times, which we haven't seen in previous seasons, and it's been great racing,"" he said.
""Of a sample of two, you'd have to say it's a big tick in the box for the ability to follow closely and race wheel to wheel. It's been outstanding.""
The next round is Australia on April 10 before Formula One returns to Europe and a home race for Ferrari at Italy's Imola.
""It's now going to be about development, about unlocking potential with these cars that are still very immature,"" said Horner.
""We can see Ferrari are very, very quick and it's going to be a busy period through the rest of the spring now to try and get performance to the cars, understand how the tyres are working and so on over these next few races.""
Ferrari lead the way to Melbourne, having scored 78 points from a maximum 88 available, but Binotto said Red Bull were still the team to beat.
""I think it will be again a good battle, a tight battle. I believe that still Red Bull is very fast, they are the strongest because they have the world champion,"" he said.
""I would say they are still the favourites and we try to do our best, let's see. There are a lot of situations that may happen.""
Red Bull are in second place in the constructor standings with 37 points, a point behind Mercedes, but they failed to score in Bahrain and reliability is always a concern.
""Luck tends to even itself out over the course of a year,"" said Horner.
""We've just got to go race by race. We're off the mark now. We're on the scoreboard, we've won our first race of the year, both drivers have been very competitive and we've just got to build some momentum.""
Red Bull have plenty of straight line speed, while Ferrari were faster through the corners in Jeddah, and different tracks will play to individual strengths.
Once-dominant champions Mercedes meanwhile must tame a 'porpoising' car to get back in the game.
""It's a very intense battle with Ferrari,"" said Horner. ""I have no doubt Mercedes will at some point join that battle but my focus is very much on our team.""","['203_0', '203_1', '203_2']","[""\n      Formula One F1 - Saudi Arabia Grand Prix - Jeddah Corniche Circuit, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia - March 27, 2022 Red Bull's Max Verstappen crosses the line to win the race ahead of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed/Pool\n    "", ""\n      Formula One F1 - Saudi Arabia Grand Prix - Jeddah Corniche Circuit, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia - March 27, 2022 Red Bull's Max Verstappen after winning the race on the podium with second placed Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and third placed Ferrari's Carlos Sainz Jr. REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed\n    "", ""\n      Formula One F1 - Saudi Arabia Grand Prix - Jeddah Corniche Circuit, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia - March 27, 2022 Red Bull's Max Verstappen celebrates winning the race on the podium with second placed Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and third placed Ferrari's Carlos Sainz Jr. REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed\n    ""]"

His family had said at the time that the 81-year-old, youngest son of prominent 1930s British fascist Oswald Mosley, died after a long battle with cancer.
British media said the remote inquest at Westminster Coroner's Court revealed Mosley had been informed he had only weeks to live.
A neighbour and his housekeeper summoned the emergency services after finding a note on his bedroom door saying 'do not enter, call the police'.
The inquest heard Mosley told his long-time personal assistant Henry Alexander a day earlier that he intended to take his own life.
The BBC quoted coroner Fiona Wilcox saying she was 'satisfied' Mosley had intended to kill himself.
Mosley became president of the International Automobile Federation (FIA), Formula One's governing body, in 1993. He stayed in office for 16 years.
In 2008 he won a high-profile privacy case against the now-defunct News of the World newspaper after it published video footage of him taking part in what it called a ""sick Nazi orgy"".
The tabloid said it involved Nazi-style role-play, which Mosley denied and the newspaper failed to back up in court.

The Las Vegas Grand Prix's 6.12km track will see drivers roar past landmarks such as the Bellagio Fountains and Caesars Palace for an event expected to attract 170,000 fans. 
""We are doing something spectacular,"" Stefano Domenicali, CEO of Formula One, told Reuters while overlooking the Las Vegas Strip, which lit up with ads for the event after it was announced.
""It's the perfect marriage. We are in an iconic city, we're going to have the right atmosphere, the right intensity, the right passion. 
""We feel at home here already."" 
Formula One races are usually staged on Sundays and the Saturday night race shows that the sport is ""not static"" and can adapt to its environment, he said.
The city will also need to adapt for the race, which Nevada governor Steve Sisolak said will have a $1 billion impact on the local economy.
""I predict that this will become the iconic race, the flagship race, of F1 within a couple years,"" Sisolak said.
""That's how well this is going to be received.""
Drivers were eager to participate in the race, which has not been given an exact date.
""I cannot believe it,"" AlphaTauri driver Pierre Gasly said in a video showing his reaction to the news.   
""Are we going to take that main road? No! That's going to be insane.""

""Knowing that it's a real party city, it's difficult,"" he said.
""How are you going to focus that weekend? There's going to be so much going on."" 
DRIVE TO SURVIVE
The sport previously struggled to make inroads in the United States, particularly after an infamous six car race at Indianapolis in 2005 left huge reputational damage.
But its popularity has been surging and the country will host the Miami Grand Prix in May and the United States Grand Prix in Austin in October. 
""If you think of where we were in the United States just a couple of years ago, it was difficult to have one race full of people,"" Domenicali said. 
""Now we are fully booked.""
Domenicali said the Netflix docu-series 'Drive to Survive' has also turbocharged interest. He hoped there will be a fifth season despite criticism from some drivers, including world champion Max Verstappen, that the storylines are manipulated. 
Next year's race marks the return of Formula One to Las Vegas, which was the site of the Ceasars Palace Grand Prix in the early 1980s. 
Greg Maffei, CEO of Formula One owners Liberty Media, told Reuters the race would boost the spirits and pocketbooks of the city's residents after COVID-19 took a heavy toll.

It has long been a given that the sport needs the heritage  and glamour of the Mediterranean principality, with its casino and superyachts, but the announcement this week of Las Vegas offers glitz on another level.
In what is already a competitive marketplace, relatively new floodlit races in Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia also attract billionaires and business leaders and Miami is joining the show this year.
Brown told Reuters Las Vegas was a perfect fit for Formula One and three U.S. races was the right number.
Asked about Monaco's future on a crowded calendar, the American said the principality faced increasing commercial pressures in a changing world.
""Monaco always stood for the most glamorous part of Formula One. I think Miami, Singapore, Las Vegas are starting to add some pretty glamorous markets,"" he said.
""I think Monaco needs to come up to the same commercial terms as other grands prix and also maybe needs to work with ways they can adapt their track because as our cars have become bigger, the racing has become more difficult.""
Monaco, whose street-circuit race is typically a procession with overtaking almost impossible, has paid far less than others in hosting fees but the contract is up for renewal.
""You do need to take into consideration history but then I think you need to take into consideration how's the show that it puts on,"" said Brown.
""There is also an element, which shouldn’t drive our decisions but should be part of our decisions, of what’s the economic contribution to the sport.
""I’d much rather have Monaco than not... but just like the sport is bigger than any one driver or team, I think it's bigger than any one grand prix.""
AWESOME MARKETS
Brown said the long-awaited Las Vegas deal, with the race on Saturday rather than Sunday in another break with tradition, was the right one.
""It looks very proper and all the right people are behind it. I think it’s going to be stunning for Formula One,"" he added.
He suggested other races, such as Singapore, could also be on a Saturday.
""We want to respect the history of the sport but there’s not many sports that haven’t changed in recent times to adapt to a changing world. I think a Saturday night race in Vegas is the obvious thing to do,"" he said.
Las Vegas joins Miami and Austin as a trio of U.S. races with plenty of distance between them and offering different experiences.  
""I think these are three awesome markets,"" said Brown. ""I think it’s almost the perfect schedule from an American standpoint.""
The calendar stands at a record 23 races this year, once Russia has been replaced.
The discussion has already turned on to which races might be dropped or alternated.
""If you could wave a magic wand I’d like to see something like 21 or 22 races,"" said Brown. 
""Seventeen or 18 as permanent fixtures and seven or eight that rotate because I do think to continue to grow the sport the more quality markets we can be in the better. I’d love to see us be in 30 markets but race 21 or 22 times a year.
""I think there are A markets and B markets that we race in. Maybe your B markets (should be) every other year.""

The attack by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi group cast doubts on whether Sunday's race in Jeddah would go forward but after discussions, F1 and the drivers decided collectively to carry on having received security assurances from Saudi authorities.
""Yes, it's part of the calendar,"" Domenicali said when asked whether F1 would be back in Saudi Arabia for the third edition of the grand prix next year. He added that the decision come from the sport's leadership with input from drivers and others.
""It is part of our job to make sure that we talk with all the stakeholders. Relevance is absolutely important for us as is open dialogue. But in terms of who is responsible for the commercialisation of the business, that's the entity that I represent.""
Saudi Arabia has signed a 15-year deal to host a race, with the fees contributing significantly to the bottom line for Formula One's owners Liberty Media.
The grand prix also reflects the Middle East's growing profile and influence within the sport, with state-owned energy giant Aramco a major F1 sponsor and joint title partner of the Aston Martin team.
Saudi Arabia has come under international scrutiny for its record on human rights, especially following the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018.
A US intelligence report released just over a year ago said Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had approved an operation to capture or kill Khashoggi, but the Saudi government denied any involvement by the crown prince and rejected the report's findings.
Saudi Arabia denies accusations of human rights abuses and says it protects its national security through its laws.
Domenicali said F1 can act as a force for change in the region.
""We always talk about the fact that Formula One and sport puts a spotlight on the positivity,"" he said.
""Our lens on every place we go gives an extra responsibility in the areas where they are trying to progress. And Formula One will make sure that will happen in a faster time.""
He said the make up of the crowd at Sunday's Saudi Arabian Grand Prix supported his case.
""If you were there last weekend, you could understand what I mean. The younger generation, women attending, kids,"" he said.
""Don't forget that a couple of years ago, they were not able go out.""",['195_0'],"['\nFormula One chief executive Stefano Domenicali attends the 150th anniversary celebration of Italian tyremaker in Milan, Italy, January 28, 2022. REUTERS/Flavio Lo Scalzo\n']"

Ferrari, who have not won a title in over a decade, lead both the drivers and constructors standings after impressing in the first two races of the season.
But Mercedes, winners of the last eight constructors titles, are busy playing catch-up due to aerodynamics issues with their cars, with team boss Toto Wolff describing their travails as going through an ""exercise in humility"".
""Mercedes would be the first to admit that they haven't got it right. Ferrari have done a really good job in moving up and being right there with Red Bull,"" Smedley said in an interview.
""But I would expect that to change now more than any other year as people find big chunks of performance in lots of different areas.
""The development phase of the car is at such an immature stage, the cars will change significantly from the first race to the final race... There's going to be a very, very strong development curve on those cars.""
Smedley, a former Ferrari race engineer, said it was brilliant for Formula One to have the Italian team, the ""most iconic of all brands"", fighting at the front again.
With Haas and Alpine also performing better than their midfield rivals so far, Smedley added that the large scale regulation change had given teams an opportunity to cause an ""upset in the world order"".
""It was always going to be the case that some would get it right and some would get it wrong,"" he added.
""I think that's the beauty, that's certainly what Formula One were hoping for in making the big regulatory changes, that you do change the world order.
""But you not only change it, you can then see some evolution throughout the season.""
AERODYNAMIC DESIGN OVERHAUL
The new era has already delivered exhilarating battles on track and Smedley said the overhaul in design was born out of a survey that revealed fans wanted to see closer racing and more ""wheel-to-wheel action"".
""If you think about all the iconic moments in Formula One over the years, it's always had two-three drivers going head-to-head in these really classic battles on the track and racing at 200 mph close to each other,"" Smedley said.
""The resolution came about from understanding why the cars didn't follow closely to each other... Individual teams who were very focused on their car's performance inadvertently created a detrimental performance for following cars.""
With the old regulations, Smedley explained a car was losing approximately 50per cent of its aerodynamic performance when it got to within half a second of a rival, leading to the redesign of its principal architecture.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) enabled them to run more simulations and exponentially reduce the development time from nearly a decade to just 18 months to arrive at a finished product and get the new era up and running this year.
""What would have happened (without AWS) is we would have shoe-horned in significantly less design and development into the period,"" he added.
""We would have ended up therefore with a regulation set that was probably much more open to interpretation.
""Which is what was happening in the past, allowing teams to go off in many different directions and lose the high level objectives the sport's rights holders were trying to set.""",['194_0'],"[""\nMercedes' Lewis Hamilton in action after the race. (Photo: Pool via REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed)\n""]"

The Telegraph reported on Sunday that FA Cup winners could potentially qualify for the Champions League from 2024 under new rules being considered by UEFA, but only if the clubs have a record of success in European competition.
The report said the proposals will see the two extra places in a new 36-team Champions League awarded on the basis of coefficients - the formula UEFA uses to measure historic success in the competition.
""We talk about being inclusive in football, that means to give all the teams the opportunity to get there,"" Moyes told reporters after Sunday's 2-1 Premier League win over Everton.
""If a smaller side won it, we'd expect to be treated the same way,"" he added. 
""Maybe if I was at a top-six regular, would I want that? I don't think most people see that as the correct format to go. It should be on merit.""
Moyes' team are sixth in the Premier League on 51 points after 31 matches, three points behind fourth-placed Tottenham Hotspur, who have played a game less. 
They host Olympique Lyonnais in the first leg of the Europa League quarter-finals on Thursday.

191,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/good-be-back-home-struggling-ricciardo-2608421,Good to be back home for struggling Ricciardo,"MELBOURNE :     Daniel Ricciardo thinks he might once have taken the Australian Grand Prix for granted but three years without any Formula One action at Albert Park has left him hankering for a race on home soil.
The 32-year-old will get his wish this weekend when the world championship circuit returns to Melbourne for the first time since the 2020 race was called off at the 11th hour as the COVID-19 pandemic first took a grip on Australia.
The eight-times Grand Prix winner's last race in Melbourne, his first for Renault, was effectively ended in the first few seconds when he lost his front end in the trackside grass, leaving him with even more of a sense of longing.     
""In a way, it's kind of like, 'You don't know what you've got until it's gone',"" the Australian told the Herald Sun newspaper.
""When I look back, obviously we were there in 2020 but we did not race, we were there in 2019 but my race did not last very long. 
""It feels like the last time I actually had a proper race there was in 2018 so it has been a long time so I am very, very excited to get back.
""Whether we are competitive or not I think just to race on home soil will be a good time."" 
Now in his second season at McLaren, Ricciardo has good reason to question the competitiveness of his car after finishing 14th at the season-opener in Bahrain and being forced to retire in Saudi Arabia.
That is a stark contrast with his former team Red Bull, who have already got their first win of the season through world champion Max Verstappen. 
Ricciardo, who twice finished fourth at Albert Park with Red Bull, accepts that there will always be questions about his decision to walk away from the team at the end of the 2018 season.   
""It doesn’t bother me,"" he added. ""Obviously at the time I felt like that was the right thing for me. You kind of stand by that ... 
""It's not something I look back on and regret it, or think I should have done differently.""

190,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/albert-park-upgrade-offers-hope-fast-and-furious-2611766,Albert Park upgrade offers hope for the fast and furious ,"MELBOURNE :     Australian Grand Prix organisers will hope the days of single-lane racing at Albert Park are over as they unveil long-awaited changes to Melbourne's lakeside circuit this week.
Albert Park has hosted Formula One's Australian stop since the state government snatched it from Adelaide some 25 years ago, turning public roads and car parks into a race track for a few weeks every year.
Until this year, the circuit had stuck resolutely to the layout of the first race in 1996 despite the vast evolution of the cars.
Though one of the more visually pleasing tracks on the calendar, it drew criticism for lacking passing opportunities, gripes that only grew in volume as the cars sped up.
Valtteri Bottas, now driving for Alfa Romeo, won the last race for Mercedes in 2019 having led from the first turn, a fairly typical outcome in Melbourne.
The upgrade may reduce the chances of similar processions.
It has seen the bumpy street circuit resurfaced and shortened by 28 metres, with seven corners modified and two turns taken out altogether, bringing the total down to 14.
One of the more significant changes is the widening of turn one, the scene of some memorable crashes as cars jostled for position in a narrow funnel after taking off from the grid.
The corner is now 2.5m wider, giving drivers more racing lines in the crucial opening moments.
Turn six, once a tight right hander, has been widened by more than 7.5m, which is expected to hike speeds by 70 km per hour.
The old chicane between turns nine and 10 has been removed, effectively transforming the section into a 1.3km 'straight' where drivers will put the foot down.
After breakneck speeds from turn six through to turn 10, turn 11, widened by three metres, will be a key attacking zone, with the camber also altered to force harder braking to negotiate the corner.
The changes have paved the way for four DRS zones, where drivers can adjust flaps on their rear wings to reduce drag and improve their chances of overtaking.    
The pitlane has also been widened by two metres with the intention that its speed limit will be raised from 60kph to 80 kph. This could lead to more strategic options for teams due to the reduced time spent pitting.
With COVID-19 scrapping the last two Australian races, organisers hope the circuit's upgrade will prove a hit with the drivers and a thrill for returning motor sport fans.
McLaren's Australian driver Daniel Ricciardo said fans should expect a different kind of race.
""Not taking credit, but I was a little bit involved in the talks about revamping the circuit a few years ago when they had the first idea of what to do to try to make the racing a bit better,"" he told reporters in Melbourne on Wednesday.
""I think it is going to be a different spectacle this time around.
""We obviously have to go there now and let our actions to do the talking, but on paper I think there is promise with that.""

189,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/soccer-evertons-68-year-top-flight-run-danger-after-burnley-loss-2613016,Soccer - Everton's 68-year top flight run in danger after Burnley loss,"BURNLEY, England :     Everton's run of 68 years in the English top flight is in real danger of ending after they slumped to a 3-2 defeat at fellow strugglers Burnley on Wednesday leaving manager Frank Lampard grasping for answers.
Everton have won two of the nine games since former Chelsea player and manager Lampard was brought in to secure their top-flight survival after Rafa Benitez was sacked in January.
The Merseysiders gave up a 2-1 lead in the second half with an awful defensive mistake from Ben Godfrey helping the Clarets create an 85th minute winner converted by Maxwel Cornet.
""The only talking we can do is on the pitch. We've got nine games to play for. I will give everything for these nine games,"" said Lampard.
His team looked distraught at the final whistle but the words from Lampard's opposite number Sean Dyche were damning.
""You sense a team doesn't know how to win a game. I said to our players that this lot don't know how to win a game away from home,"" said Dyche when asked what he told his team at the break after two Richarlison penalties gave the visitors the advantage.
Everton have one away win all season and the worst record on the road in the division with six points from 15 games.
Burnley certainly played with a belief which belied their own lowly position but the win moves them above Watford to 18th place, one point away from Everton and the safety zone.
TOUGH GAMES
Everton host Manchester United on Saturday - the first of a series of tough games in their run-in - and Lampard said his team's self-belief was now the main issue.
""The effort is there, belief will be tested,"" he said.
""When you lose it's a test of belief. The players are disappointed at the end. In terms of the general performance I didn't hate it at all. The goals are not goals that we should concede.
""I don't need picking up. I'm the one that needs to be picking people up. As much as it feels not great tonight, tomorrow you've got to focus on Saturday,"" he added.
""Manchester United will be a completely different game, with an understanding of the pressure that's now on it. We can't pretend tonight didn't happen, we have to be on a good edge against United.""
While Everton have never dropped out of the Premier League, Burnley are relative veterans in relegation struggles under Dyche and he said the formula for survival was a familiar one.
""You have to score at the right time, not concede at the right time and get wins. That has been the story of our seasons in the Premier League,"" he explained.
""Tonight we got on the right side of the margin but it is only one win, I just said that to the players, and it is a good atmosphere in the changing room and the stadium, but it doesn’t change anything. We have nine more of them to go"".

The Dutch Red Bull driver is hot property for media, sponsors and fans after his 2021 triumph, and the relaxation of biosecurity protocols could mean more demands on his time.
""Even if there is no COVID for sure I’m not going to do more ... on weekends because I’m there to race, I’m not there to entertain the crowds,"" he told a small group of reporters on Thursday at Albert Park ahead of Sunday's Australian Grand Prix.
""I’ll entertain them by doing that on the track. Otherwise you get upset, you don’t feel good and it’s going to hurt your performance.
""So you need to just keep it exactly the same, the same approach as other race weekends.""
Verstappen said he felt sympathy for McLaren's Australian driver Daniel Ricciardo, having seen him battle through busy schedules at his home Grand Prix when they were Red Bull team mates.
""I always felt sorry for him because he was always so busy,"" said Verstappen.
""He actually never really got to fully enjoy it. Maybe he manages it differently now but I remember when he was here it was tough, he was super busy in the week leading up to the Grand Prix.
""So I hope for him that at least he can enjoy it a bit more now because I think it is very special to have a home Grand Prix.""
Verstappen, who became the youngest driver to compete in F1 when he debuted at the 2015 Australian Grand Prix as a 17-year-old, said experience had taught him how to balance his schedule.
""You need the right people around you as well to manage you in that,"" added the 24-year-old.
""Of course at one point as a driver you know what you need to feel good in the car and you really know how many commitments you can do on a weekend.
""But you should be able to say 'no' to certain commitments. At the end of the day you are here to drive and to race because that’s what you live for and what you get paid to do.""

Plenty has changed since Valtteri Bottas won the 2019 race for Mercedes in Melbourne, kicking off another season dominated by former team mate Lewis Hamilton and the Silver Arrows.
In its first upgrade in a quarter of a century, Albert Park has been re-surfaced and had corners removed to encourage passing and hopefully put an end to processional race-days.
Mercedes and Hamilton, meanwhile, have fallen off their perch, leaving Ferrari and Red Bull the talk of the paddock after the season-opening swing through Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.
The Ferrari car's early strength and the budding rivalry between Charles Leclerc and Red Bull's world champion Max Verstappen has motor sport pundits raving.
Whether it is renewed interest in the series or just a spell of balmy autumn weather, fans thronged to Albert Park on Thursday and bumper crowds are tipped through the weekend in a city which spent some 260 days locked down through the pandemic.
""The drivers are smiling, fans are smiling and the weather gods are smiling on us,"" Australian Grand Prix Corporation boss Andrew Westacott told Reuters.
""It's a much, much quicker circuit and I expect it's going to produce great racing on the weekend.""
Many fans will hope that means more duelling between Dutchman Verstappen and fellow 24-year-old Leclerc, whose battles lit up the Middle Eastern double-header.
Verstappen, who had a non-finish at Bahrain but bounced back a winner in Saudi Arabia, said he would prefer to avoid going wheel-to-wheel with Leclerc by driving an improved car.
""For the viewers, it's good,"" he said on Thursday of their rivalry which dates back to their go-karting days.
""Of course I enjoy the battles but I’m also more focused on actually trying to make the car better and to get a better feeling in the car, and then hopefully we don’t need to battle in every single race.""
Verstappen said Red Bull had made ""little steps"" developing their car since Jeddah but stopped short of tipping a big weekend in Melbourne.
""We’ll do our best but at the moment we don’t know how the car’s going to perform,"" he said.
Mercedes might also fall into that camp, having produced a car that bounces, or 'porpoises', on the straights as downforce comes and goes.
After Hamilton finished 10th in Jeddah and his new team mate George Russell came fifth, the team are 40 points behind Ferrari, and just one clear of Red Bull who suffered dual retirements in Bahrain.
Team boss Toto Wolff warned there would be no ""magic fix"" for the W13 car's troubles in time for Sunday's race.
""But we're pushing to steadily bring gains over the upcoming races, to hopefully move us closer to the front of the pack.""
Four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel may be grateful just to be racing, after missing the first two rounds due to a positive COVID-19 test.
The Aston Martin driver's seat was filled by Nico Hulkenberg but he makes his return in Melbourne, hoping to notch his team's first points of the season.

AUSTRALIA
No Australian driver has ever won a home grand prix.
There have been 13 Australian F1 drivers since 1950 and two world champions - Jack Brabham and Alan Jones. McLaren's  Daniel Ricciardo is the only Australian in Sunday’s race.
This year’s race will be the 25th to be held at Albert Park, and 36th Australian Grand Prix. It was held in Adelaide, as the final race of the year, between 1985 and 1995. 
Four current drivers have won before in Melbourne and three  are world champions: Lewis Hamilton (2008, 2015), Sebastian Vettel (2011, 2017, 2018) and Fernando Alonso (2006). The odd man out is Valtteri Bottas, winner for Mercedes in 2019.
Aston Martin's Vettel is starting his season this weekend after missing the first two races due to COVID-19.  
Hamilton has been on pole in Melbourne for the last six editions and eight times in total (2008, 2012, 2014 to 2019), a record for the race.
The lowest starter to win was Britain’s Eddie Irvine from 11th in 1999 for Ferrari. Fifteen of the 24 races in Melbourne have been won from the front row. 
RACE WINS
Hamilton has a record 103 career victories from 290 starts, the most recent being in Saudi Arabia last December.
Ferrari have won 239 races since 1950, McLaren 183, Mercedes 124, Williams 114 and Red Bull 76.
Ferrari have made their best start to a season since 2004.
POLE POSITION
Hamilton has a record 103 career poles, most recently qualifying fastest in Saudi Arabia last year.
POINTS
Ferrari's Charles Leclerc is 12 points clear of team mate Carlos Sainz after two races. Sainz has finished the last 17 races in the points. 
Haas have scored in successive races for the first time since 2019.
Aston Martin and Williams have yet to score a point in 2022.
MILESTONE
Mercedes are chasing their 125th win in Formula One.
Four drivers are racing in Australia for the first time - Nicholas Latifi (Williams), Mick Schumacher (Haas), Yuki Tsunoda (AlphaTauri) and Guanyu Zhou (Alfa Romeo).

The German carmaker, which has not previously been involved with Formula One but has worked with Red Bull in the world rally championship, did not announce how it planned on entering the sport.
The two brands will provide further information on the details at a later date, the spokesperson said.
A Formula One spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.
Audi is ready to offer around 500 million euros (US$556.30 million) for British luxury sports carmaker McLaren as a means to enter, a source told Reuters last week, while Porsche intends to establish a long-term partnership with racing team Red Bull starting in several years' time.

The decision comes as Volkswagen prepares for a possible listing of Porsche AG planned for the fourth quarter of this year, though sources said the entry into Formula One racing would likely only happen in a few years time.

Alonso returned at the start of last season following a two-year break after becoming disillusioned with the sport and took up his one-year contract extension with Alpine for this season.
Australian reserve driver Oscar Piastri is waiting for his chance but Alonso said he did not feel pressure to retain his seat.
“Obviously if I was 25 there would not be this talk,"" he told reporters at Albert Park on Friday ahead of the Australian Grand Prix.
“It's an age thing that people try to find a way for the young talents. But I think this is about performance.""
The oldest driver in F1, Alonso finished 10th in the championship last season, seven points ahead of his 11th-placed French team mate Esteban Ocon.
“Last year, I think I did well. I finished slightly in front of Esteban,"" he said.
""Let's see this year how the battle goes. This is about performance, not about age.
""As I said at the beginning of the year, I still feel competitive and fast, and feel that I am enjoying time in Formula 1.
“So, I will race, I guess, a couple more years - two or three more years.""
Alonso, ninth in the Bahrain season-opener, will hope to be back in the points at Albert Park on Sunday after failing to finish in Saudi Arabia.","['181_0', '181_1', '181_2', '181_3', '181_4']","[""\n      Alpine's Fernando Alonso during a press conference.

180,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/ferrari-top-australian-gp-practice-2615786,Ferrari on top in Australian GP practice ,"MELBOURNE: Ferrari's promising start to the Formula One season continued on Friday (Apr 8) as the glamour team dominated free practice at the Australian Grand Prix at a revamped Albert Park circuit.
Ferrari's championship leader Charles Leclerc topped the timesheets with a lap of one minute, 18.978 in second free practice after being second to team mate Carlos Sainz in the first.
However, Red Bull showed they will be nipping at their heels this weekend with world champion Max Verstappen splitting the Ferraris in the second session, 0.245 seconds adrift of Leclerc.
The Dutchman was fourth quickest in the first session.
Twice world champion Fernando Alonso surprised by briefly topping the timesheets for Alpine before finishing fourth fastest in the second session, one ahead of Red Bull's Sergio Perez.
Mercedes were well off the pace, with George Russell 11th quickest in the second session, more than 1.2 seconds adrift of Leclerc. His seven-times championship-winning team mate Hamilton was 13th quickest.
Two years after the race was scrapped due to COVID-19, the drivers struggled to get to grips with changes at the lakeside circuit, with fewer corners and wider turns making it a different proposition to the old lay-out.
Red flags came out in both sessions as cars left debris on the resurfaced track, and a number skidded into the gravel.
Four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel, who missed the first two races after a positive COVID-19 test, had a forgettable return to the track.
After posting the 13th quickest lap in first free practice, his Aston Martin lost power and ground to a halt 15 minutes before the end of the session, with smoke billowing out of the rear.
The German grabbed a fire extinguisher from a track marshal and gave his car a spray to put out the fire.
He later delighted fans by riding back to the team garage on a scooter, prompting an investigation by stewards for entering the track without permission.
That was the last fans saw of Vettel on track as he did not return for the second session. The team confirmed his car's power unit would need to be changed.
It was the second red flag of the earlier session, with Perez forcing a halt by leaving some body-work debris on the track.","['180_0', '180_1', '180_2', '180_3', '180_4']","[""\n      Ferrari's Charles Leclerc in action during practice.

Las Vegas will join Austin and Miami as the third race in the United States in the 2023 calendar as F1 looks to make further inroads into the lucrative market.
The championship's expansion into new territory has put some of the older European races under scrutiny, with F1 boss Stefano Domenicali warning that some might need to make way for new ones elsewhere.
Four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel said while it was exciting to have new destinations on the calendar, it would be a shame to drop older European races like Monaco or Monza in Italy.
""Obviously there is financial interest in new places that we are going to and F1 is a business. But I think for us it's a sport; it's a passion,"" the Aston Martin driver said.
""So we don't see it as a business.
""Places mean something because of the history they have or the tradition they have.
""I think it needs a sort of mixture between exploring but also holding onto places that have history.""
Red Bull's Sergio Perez was thrilled with the prospect of Las Vegas joining the calendar but said F1 needed to keep its ""historic tracks"".
""And we have to make sure that when we go to new venues, to really have some character on the tracks, you know,"" said the Mexican.
""I felt like some of the new tracks kind of lack a bit of character. So that will be very important.""
Seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton, meanwhile, said he wanted South Africa returned to the F1 calendar.
Nearly 30 years have passed since the country hosted an F1 race in 1993, and Africa is the only inhabited continent which does not feature on the current calendar.
""We're pretty much on every other continent, so why not?"" said Mercedes driver Hamilton.
""And ultimately, my ancestors are from there so that's why it is important for me personally.""","['179_0', '179_1', '179_2', '179_3']","[""\n      Red Bull's Max Verstappen (left) and Red Bull's Sergio Perez talk to the media ahead of the  Australian Grand Prix.

The Dutchman, who won the last race in Saudi Arabia, posted the fourth quickest lap in the first free practice but was second only to Ferrari's Charles Leclerc in the second session.
He said tweaks to his car during the last session had ironed out some balancing issues, making him a lot happier behind the wheel.
""We're a tiny bit off Ferrari but I do think that we can maybe make it a little bit closer,"" he told reporters in the paddock.
""But they are quick again. In the long run everything looked quite stable and quite nice so I'm happy about that. We definitely made some good improvements today.""
Two years after the Australian Grand Prix was cancelled due to COVID-19, hours before the first practice, some of the drivers struggled on their return to a vastly different track.
The re-surfaced circuit's new lay-out, which features fewer corners and some wider turns, saw a number of cars skid off on Friday.
Verstappen, however, was a fan of the upgrade, Albert Park's first since its F1 debut in 1996.
""It's good. I think the track grip is quite nice,"" he said.
""The bumps definitely improved, it's smoother.
""But I think it actually makes the track nicer as well because you can attack the corners a bit better now, being a bit more smooth.
""They did a good job with that. I enjoyed my laps today.""

It was not quite the return to action the German had expected after missing the first two races of the season due to contracting COVID-19.
Vettel had managed a few laps but his car soon stopped with smoke billowing out the rear.
After getting out, the German grabbed a fire extinguisher off a track marshal and gave the car a spray.
Session over, he then rode along the track back to the pits on a motor scooter with his helmet perched on the top of his head, at one point waving at fans with both hands.
Stewards summoned Vettel and fined him for a breach of the sporting regulations in entering the track without permission during a five minute period after a session had ended.
Vettel insisted he had been given the all-clear by a marshal who had offered him use of the scooter.
""I said, 'Can I drive it?' Because I prefer to drive myself,"" he told reporters in the paddock.
""And then he handed me the scooter, so I said, 'OK,’ and he said, ‘Off you go.’ And I went.
""I mean I would like to get the car back and not to have a problem in the first place. I'm not here to drive a scooter.""
Stewards said Vettel had set off alone and on the track rather than a designated route while the marshal tried to contact race control for instructions.
Vettel, who posted the 13th fastest lap before his mishap, was unable to return for the second free practice, with Aston Martin confirming it would need to swap in a new power unit.
""It will be fine tomorrow but it would have been nice to get a few more laps,"" he said.

McLaren, Aston Martin and Williams all use Mercedes power units at present with the latter two also seen as potential Audi partners. Other current engine makers are Ferrari and Renault.

Leclerc's car was dominant on the upgraded Albert Park circuit as the Monagesque sealed his fourth career win more than 20 seconds ahead of Red Bull's runnerup Sergio Perez.
Third-placed George Russell grabbed his second podium and first for Mercedes in an encouraging day for the struggling constructors' champions.
""What a race and what pace,"" said a thrilled Leclerc on the team radio, having finished more than 20 seconds ahead of Perez in the 58-lap race.
""The car was incredible today, well done guys.""
Winner of the season-opener in Bahrain, 24-year-old Leclerc has now built a 34-point lead over Russell to emerge as early favourite for the drivers' championship.
Ferrari's celebrations were tempered by Carlos Sainz crashing out shortly after the start, while four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel of Aston Martin crashed his car on his return after missing the opening races due to COVID-19.
Verstappen was second behind Leclerc when his RB18 car suffered a reliability problem and rolled to a halt during his 39th lap with smoke billowing.
""I smell some weird fluid,"" said Verstappen before coming to a stop at turn two.
Yet he would have had little hope of reeling in Leclerc.
""I knew I could not fight Charles so there was no point to try and put pressure on him,"" Verstappen told Sky.
""But we didn't even finish the race so it's pretty frustrating and unacceptable.""
It was a similar outcome to the season-opener in Bahrain, where Verstappen retired three laps from the end while on course for a second-place finish.
Lewis Hamilton finished fourth for Mercedes after starting fifth on the grid, having been passed by Russell due to a safety car deployment.
McLaren's Lando Norris and Daniel Ricciardo finished fifth and sixth respectively as the team showed improvement after a poor start to the season.
Sainz, who started ninth on the grid after set-up troubles in qualifying, had a dreadful start then skidded into grass before spinning across the track, somehow missing oncoming traffic before coming to a stop in gravel at turn 10.
Vettel later locked up on a kerb at turn four before shunting his Aston Martin into a wall and leaving a trail of debris across the track.
Vettel's crash saw the safety car deployed again, and Russell capitalised by pitting before rejoining in third place ahead of Perez and Hamilton.
Leclerc's lead was wiped out by the safety car and nearly taken out as Verstappen swooped after the restart but the Monagesque saw off the Dutchman and built his lead to the finish.
Alex Albon started 19th on the grid but finished 10th, grabbing a first point for Williams after managing his hard tyres virtually to the finish.
Organisers said an estimated 420,000 people flocked to Albert Park over the race week, making it the biggest attendance for a weekend sporting event in Australia. ","['173_0', '173_1', '173_2', '173_3', '173_4']","[""\n      Ferrari's Charles Leclerc celebrates on the podium after winning the race with second place Red Bull's Sergio Perez and third place Mercedes' George Russell.

Starting from pole, the 24-year-old from Monaco crossed the finish line more than 20 seconds ahead of Red Bull's runner-up Sergio Perez to claim his fourth career win in style.
Having gone winless in the last two years as Ferrari struggled, Leclerc has now won two of the last three races, including the season-opener in Bahrain, to emerge as the early championship favourite.
""It feels incredible ... because now I know underneath me I've got a car that is capable of winning,"" Leclerc told reporters.
""I know that it's in the car and I just have to do the job, so the mindset is a little bit different this year.""
Leclerc has now taken a 34-point lead in the drivers' championship ahead of George Russell, who was third for Mercedes on Sunday.
Ferrari head to their home Italian Grand Prix in two weeks with huge momentum, but Leclerc tried to clamp down on the growing hype.
""I don't want to focus too much on the championship for now,"" he said.
""Italy will be incredible, but we need to approach the race weekend just like we approach the first three weekends.
""I think it's extremely important not to put on ourselves extra pressure and not try to overdo things.""
Ferrari's celebrations were tempered by a crash for Leclerc's partner driver Carlos Sainz soon after he suffered a terrible start from ninth on the grid on hard tyres.
After a skid through grass, he spun across the track and thudded into a wall to finish his race quickly.
That followed set-up problems with his car during qualifying on Saturday.
Sainz said he made a mistake with his tyres but was already disrupted by having his steering wheel changed just before his installation lap.

Ferrari's Charles Leclerc won the Australian Grand Prix at a canter, crossing more than 20 seconds ahead of Red Bull's runner-up Sergio Perez, while Verstappen's car ground to a halt with nearly 20 laps to race.
Red Bull have now racked up three retirements in the first three races, with both Verstappen and Perez failing to finish the season-opener in Bahrain.
Ferrari are 39 points clear of second-placed Mercedes in the constructors championship, with Red Bull a further 10 points adrift.
""Desperately frustrating. I think as Max said, we didn't have the pace to race Charles today, they were in a league of their own,"" said Horner.
""But frustrating not to be bagging those points.
""We can't accept DNFs (did not finish) but we need to understand what the issue is and address it.""
Red Bull blamed a fuel system problem for the retirements in Bahrain, and Horner suspected Verstappen's failure in Melbourne might also be fuel-related.
More concerning was the car's performance gap versus Ferrari, which has taken Red Bull by surprise.
""I'd rather fix a fast car than try and make a reliable, slow one fast. We need to get on top of it,"" said Horner.
""You could see the front tyres open up quite quickly in the race and that's usually the sign that you haven't got your balance totally tuned in.""
With no points booked for a second race this season, Verstappen has fallen to sixth in the drivers' championship, 46 points behind Leclerc.
Verstappen complained about his car's performance all week, and said he knew there was a problem brewing.
""We are already miles behind so I don't even want to think about the championship fight at the moment,"" said the Dutchman.
""I think it's more important to finish races. Of course today was in general just a bad day again.
""But we didn't even finish the race so it's pretty frustrating and unacceptable.""
Verstappen's retirement paved the way for Perez's runner-up finish, though the Mexican had to fight his way past third-placed Mercedes driver George Russell and the Briton's team mate Lewis Hamilton to secure his 16th podium.

Albon's epic run on the first set of tyres helped secure Williams their first championship point of the season.
Staying on track despite multiple safety car periods, Albon pitted on the penultimate lap at Albert Park to switch to soft tyres.
That allowed several cars to pass him but he sneaked in front of Alfa Romeo's Zhou Guanyu and held on to 10th through the final lap.
""Just call him the tyre whisperer,"" Williams said on their social media account.
Albon's small triumph came after a difficult race week for Williams, with Nicholas Latifi's car suffering heavy damage after a collision with Aston Martin's Lance Stroll during qualifying.
Albon carried a three-place grid penalty to Melbourne after colliding with Stroll at the previous race in Saudi Arabia.
Albon was then disqualified from qualifying on Saturday over a fuel rule breach.
There were jubilant scenes in the Williams garage as Albon crossed the line, and the British-born Thai said the result was completely unexpected.
""We haven't had the greatest start to the season and it really means a lot,"" he said in the Albert Park paddock.

New race director Niels Wittich wrote in pre-race Australian Grand Prix notes that ""the wearing of jewellery in the form of body piercing or metal neck chains is prohibited during the competition"".
Hamilton, the sport's most successful driver, told reporters after finishing fourth for Mercedes in Melbourne that he would not be shedding his ear piercings and a nose stud.
""I don't have any plans on removing (them),"" said the 37-year-old.
""I feel there are personal things. You should be able to be who you are,"" he added.
""There is stuff that I can't move. I literally can't even take these out. These ones on my right ear, they are literally welded in so I have to get them chopped off or something like that. So they will be staying.""
The ban on wearing jewellery during the race is for safety reasons and is set out in Appendix L of the FIA's International Sporting Code. While not new, it has not been rigorously enforced.
The topic was also raised at a drivers' briefing on Friday along with a discussion about the requirement for flame-resistant underwear.

167,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/woods-already-comeback-story-ages-2619326,Woods already a comeback story for the ages,"AUGUSTA: Tiger Woods finished near the bottom of the Masters leaderboard Sunday (Apr 10), but even teeing up this week at Augusta National puts the 15-time major winner among a select band of legendary sports comebacks.
Woods worked the golf world into a frenzy on Thursday when he carded a one-under par 71 in his first round of competitive golf since a car crash that nearly resulted in doctors amputating his right leg just 14 months ago.
The 46-year-old would make the cut but four rounds on the undulating layout proved too much as Woods closed with six-over 78s on Saturday and Sunday, his worst-ever scores at Augusta National that left him 23 shots back of winner Scottie Scheffler.
For golf fans the Woods saga has conjured the memory of Ben Hogan, one of the sport's all-time greats. Hogan suffered multiple injuries in a near-fatal car accident in 1949 that left doctors fearing he might never walk again - but went on to win six majors.
""Obviously, he didn't have the technology that we have now, but the amount of hot tubs that he would have to take pre-round, post-round, in the middle of the night, just to be able to get up and swing a club the next day, I certainly appreciate that,"" Woods told reporters in Augusta.
""If I had to go through with my accident, given what had happened to me, during his era, I wouldn't be playing this week, that's for sure.""
Hogan is one of only a handful of sporting star names fans could expect to hear uttered in the same conversation as Woods' remarkable return.
Another is former tennis number one Monica Seles, who was unable to compete for more than two years after an on-court knife attack, but came back to win the Australian Open in 1996.
Also in the rare group would be Canadian ice hockey great Mario Lemieux, who overcame cancer and came back from a three-year retirement in 2000 before winning Olympic gold for Canada in 2002.
Three-time Formula One champion Niki Lauda's Ferrari burst into flames at the 1976 German Grand Prix. He was nearly killed by smoke inhalation and suffered severe burns - but the Austrian was back in the cockpit just six weeks later and would go on to win two more championships after the crash.
Woods demurred when compared with those kind of heroics, telling reporters he was just happy to be playing again after enduring years of surgery and personal problems.
""Just to be able to play, and not only just to play, but I put up a good first round,"" said Woods. ""I got myself there.
""I don't quite have the endurance that I would like to have had, but as of a few weeks ago, didn't even know if I was going to play in this event.

The event is set to take place at the Marina Bay Street Circuit from Sep 30 to Oct 2 after a two-year absence due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The 5.063km long track will host the 17th round of the Formula 1 championship, said Singapore GP.
The tickets include three-day grandstand offerings, priced at S$298 to S$1,288, as well as combination packages ranging from S$698 to S$1,088.
These will allow fans to “experience the exciting race action and off-track entertainment from different parts of the Circuit Park over the race weekend”, said Singapore GP.
Single-day tickets for wheelchair accessible areas for people in wheelchairs and their companions are also available at S$38, S$88 and S$128.
“With the competition heating up between Red Bull Racing's Max Verstappen and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc this season, fans at the home of Formula 1 night racing will be in for a treat,” the race promoter said.
It added that drivers such as Alfa Romeo's Zhou Guanyu, Alpha Tauri's Yuki Tsunoda, Haas’ Mick Schumacher and Williams’ Nicholas Latifi will race in Singapore for the first time.
Tickets can be purchased via the official website, the Singapore GP ticketing hotline (+65 6229 7777) or via authorised ticketing partners.
A full entertainment line-up for the event will be released in the coming weeks, said Singapore GP.

165,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/australia-hopes-keep-early-f1-slot-after-strong-reboot-2619551,Australia hopes to keep early F1 slot after strong reboot,"MELBOURNE :     Record crowds at the Australian Grand Prix were a welcome boost for organisers after a two-year hiatus due to COVID-19 but where the race sits in the Formula One calendar remains up in the air.
Albert Park has traditionally hosted the championship's opener but was slotted in as the third stop this year after a Middle East doubleheader in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.
An estimated 419,000 people flocked to Albert Park over the four-day race week from Thursday to Sunday, outstripping the previous record attendance of about 401,000 when Melbourne's lakeside circuit first hosted the Grand Prix in 1996.
While the crowds underlined a Netflix-fuelled resurgence of interest in F1, drivers were cool on the race's scheduling as a standalone week before the series continues in Italy.
""Just coming to Australia for a single race is quite painful for everyone,"" said Red Bull driver Sergio Perez, runner-up to Ferrari's Charles Leclerc on Sunday.
""We all want to come here, but there are ways we can improve and in fairness to F1, Australia hasn’t been on the calendar for the last (two) years.
""I’m sure that going forward they can have a look at it.""
While Mercedes' George Russell said Albert Park's previous scheduling as a season-opener was ""cool"", drivers may not be willing to shift from the new arrangement, which has had Bahrain hosting the first race after pre-season testing in the Gulf nation.
""It works well at the moment because we are doing the winter testing in Bahrain, it makes sense to stay there,"" said Perez.
Australia's future scheduling may depend on the proximity of other races in its East Asian timezone.
After a three-year absence due to COVID-19, China is slated to return next year, with Shanghai renewing its contract with F1 through to 2025.
Shanghai's usual April slot would be a natural tie-up for Australia in an early season Asian swing, though the Chinese government's strict ""zero-COVID"" approach could make the race untenable if sustained into 2023.
Shanghai is currently locked down as it battles China's worst outbreak of COVID-19 since it emerged in Wuhan in late 2019.
Formula One returns to east Asia in early-October with a swing through Singapore (Oct. 2) and Japan a week later.
Moving Australia to link up with Singapore and Japan in a late-season swing next year may be another option if Shanghai were to drop out again.
However, that is not a palatable option for local organisers, the Australian Grand Prix Corporation (AGPC).
""We've proven that we can have success both opening the season and coming in after a couple of races,"" AGPC boss Andrew Westacott told Reuters on Monday.
""The time for Formula One in Australia is early in the season.""
While Westacott noted a standalone race in Melbourne was unpopular with F1 teams, he said the series' expansion into new markets meant they had ""better get used to"" heading to different locations.
""The drivers have got to stop whinging in some respects,"" he said.

Motorsport's world governing body, the International Automobile Federation (FIA), said in a statement it had launched an immediate investigation into Artem Severiukhin's ""unacceptable conduct"".
The Russian's Swedish team also announced it would be terminating his contract.
Video footage showed the youngster, racing under an Italian flag due to sanctions imposed on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, tapping his chest with a clenched fist before raising his right arm in salute and then laughing.
Italy's Gazzetta dello Sport described the gesture, made while the Italian anthem was played after the Russian won the opening round of the European championship OK category in Portimao, as a Roman salute.
Film of the incident was widely circulated and condemned on social media.
Ward Racing, his team, said in a statement it was ""deeply in shame"" at his 'unsportsmanlike' behaviour.
""Ward Racing sees no possibility for continued cooperation with Artem Severiukhin and will proceed with terminating his racing contract,"" the team added.
The youngster later posted video messages in English and Russian on his Instagram account.
""I want to apologise to everyone for what happened yesterday,"" he said.
""Standing on the podium I made a gesture that many perceived as a Nazi salute. This is not true. I have never supported Nazism and consider it one of the worst crimes against humanity.""
Severiukhin said he had ""just wanted to make a gesture"" to show gratitude and could not explain everything else that happened.
""I know that I am a fool and I'm ready to be punished but please believe that there was no intention in my actions, there was no support for Nazism or Fascism. There was no desire to offend spectators, fans, athletes or the team.""
The FIA, which is also Formula One's governing body, announced last month it would continue to allow individual Russian drivers to take part in its competitions but not under the country's flag as no Russian symbols or colours can be displayed.

161,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/ferraris-hopes-run-high-after-previous-false-starts-2622326,Ferrari's hopes run high after previous false starts,"LONDON :     Ferrari fans know all about false dawns and dashed hopes but the first three races of the Formula One season have brought the good times back to Maranello and sent expectations soaring.
Charles Leclerc, seeking to become the Italian team's first world champion since Kimi Raikkonen in 2007, has taken 71 of 78 points available from the opening races in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Australia.
The Monegasque's closest rival, Britain's George Russell with Mercedes, is 34 points adrift while Red Bull's reigning world champion Max Verstappen is 46 behind after two retirements.
""Obviously we only had the third race, so it's difficult to think about the championship, but to be honest, we've got a very strong car, a very reliable car too,"" Leclerc told reporters in Melbourne at the weekend.
""I hope it continues like this and if it does, then we probably have chances for the championship - which obviously makes me smile after the last two years that have been difficult for the team and for myself.""
Ferrari, who dominated with seven times champion Michael Schumacher in the early years of the century, failed to win a race in 2020 when they slumped to a 40-year low of sixth overall.
Last year they clawed their way back to third place while Mercedes celebrated a record eighth successive constructors' crown.
This season, with a rules overhaul, the sport's oldest and most glamorous team have come out stronger than in any year since 2017, when Sebastian Vettel also won two of the first three races and finished second in the other.
Vettel, a four times champion with Red Bull from 2010-13, also won two of the opening three in 2018 but failed to maintain the momentum as Ferrari's challenge fizzled out.
Two times world champion Fernando Alonso also put up a good fight in 2010 and 2012, when the Spaniard was main man at Ferrari and Vettel's biggest rival.
This time Leclerc has the car to show off his talents, the points gap is ominous and Ferrari's rivals are sweating to match them on speed and reliability even if there are still 20 races remaining.
In Melbourne, he won from pole and led every lap with a bonus point for fastest lap, his third in three races, for a first career ‘Grand Slam’.
""We knew we had a competitive car but certainly I was not expecting such a good start to the season,"" said team boss Mattia Binotto.
""But I still believe that the difference between us and the others can be very little... and it will be a great fight in the next races.""
Imola, one of two home Italian races for Ferrari this year, is next up and Ferrari can expect strong support from their success-starved fans as they seek to build momentum.
""I don't know if it will be unstoppable, and each single race will be different, but it's great to be in Imola now with such a good start to the season after a win,"" said Binotto.

Charles Leclerc has won two of the first three races, finishing second in the other, and has a 34-point lead in the championship.
Ferrari, who last won a title in 2008 and failed to win a race in 2020 and 2021, also lead the constructors' standings by 39 points from champions Mercedes.
""We said two years ago that we had to work hard to get back to being competitive and the 2022 championship has got off to a truly thrilling start,"" Elkann said at Ferrari's annual shareholders' meeting.
Ferrari slumped to sixth overall in the 2020 season, their lowest ranking since 1980, but rose to third last year under principal Mattia Binotto and their new car looks both fast and reliable.
""Like all our tifosi (fans) around the world, I am delighted we are competing at the highest level,"" said Elkann.
""That said, we know the season has just begun and in Formula One you are always surrounded by fierce competitors. We must work tirelessly as a team to optimise every aspect of our performance.

""It was suggested that Liberty Media's demands were too excessive for Monaco and the Grand Prix would no longer be held,"" France's Auto Hebdo magazine quoted Boeri as saying of the reports.

The Briton, knighted by his own country, was in Sao Paulo to deliver a keynote speech at an event focused on business and digital transformation.
Previous keynote speakers at the VTEX Day event include former US president Barack Obama, British entrepreneur Richard Branson and former Brazilian president Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
""I want to spend more time here in Brazil...It is such a beautiful culture. I’ve only been to Rio and Sao Paulo, but I want to come back for Christmas, New Year or something,"" Hamilton said.
""(Brazilian soccer international) Neymar invites me every year, and (pro surfer) Gabriel (Medina) invites me every year, but I never had the chance ... I’m waiting for my Brazilian passport.""
A bill to make the 37-year-old an honorary citizen is pending in the lower house of the Brazilian parliament but has yet to be voted on.
The move was proposed by congressman Andre Figueiredo after last year’s Brazilian GP, at which Hamilton unfurled the Brazilian flag after winning at Sao Paulo's Interlagos circuit.
The crowd chanted his name along with that of late triple world champion Ayrton Senna, a national hero and Sao Paulo native who died at Imola in 1994.
The Briton, the most successful driver in the history of the sport who has always held up Senna as his boyhood idol, later carried the flag onto the podium to an ovation from the fans.
Presidential hopeful Ciro Gomes, a member of Figueiredo’s PDT party, backed the honorary citizenship for the Mercedes driver.

Aston Martin and Mercedes both provide safety and medical cars for grands prix, with the championship divided between the two marques and Germany's Bernd Maylander the driver.
""The FIA would like to reiterate that the primary function of the ... safety car is, of course, not outright speed but the safety of the drivers, marshals and officials,"" it said in a statement.
Red Bull's Verstappen had said after Sunday's Australian Grand Prix that the Aston Martin 4.0 litre twin-turbo V8 Vantage used in Melbourne lapped too slowly when twice deployed following crashes.
""For sure the Mercedes safety car is faster because of the extra aero. The Aston Martin is really slow. It definitely needs more grip, because our tyres were stone cold,"" the Dutchman told reporters after retiring from the race.
The Mercedes-AMG GT Black Series used in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, and new for this year, produces some 730bhp compared to the Aston's 528bhp.
Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, the championship leader and winner of two of the first three races, said he had also wanted to go faster.
""I wanted to complain, but then I checked how much the safety car was sliding in the corner and I don't think there was anything more that he could give so I didn't want to put too much pressure,"" he told reporters.
""With the cars that we have now it's very difficult to keep the temperatures in the tyres behind the safety car.""
Briton George Russell, who drives for Mercedes, said the German marque's safety car was about five seconds a lap quicker than the Aston Martin.
The FIA said safety car procedures took into account multiple factors, including the need to bunch up the field and adjust the pace depending on recovery activities.
""The speed of the safety car is therefore generally dictated by race control, and not limited by the capabilities of the safety cars,"" added the governing body.
""The impact of the speed of the safety car on the performance of the cars following is a secondary consideration, as the impact is equal amongst all competitors who ... are responsible for driving in a safe manner at all times.""",['157_0'],"['\nFormula One F1 - Bahrain Grand Prix - Bahrain International Circuit, Sakhir, Bahrain - Mar 28, 2021.

On Monday, website El Confidencial published leaked audio recordings from 2019 that revealed details about the contract negotiated by Spanish FA president Luis Rubiales and Pique with Saudi Arabia that included Kosmos receiving 4 million euros for each of the six Super Cup editions scheduled to be played in the Middle Eastern country.
""I have absolutely nothing to hide, it's all legal,"" Pique told a late night news conference on Monday that was streamed on  his social media channel. 
""We can debate the morality of it but the only illegality is the leaking of the audios. I see no ethical issues or conflict of interest either. It's the opposite, I feel proud for the spectacular job we have done bringing the Spanish Super Cup to Saudi Arabia.""
Pique said the 4 million euros paid per tournament to Kosmos represents 10 per cent of the 40 million euros that Saudi authorities agreed to pay the Spanish FA every year to bring the Super Cup to the Gulf state.
""As a commission, it is below the market value. These types of deals usually pay 15 per cent to 20 per cent,"" the Barcelona defender said while he was repeatedly quizzed by reporters who felt his involvement in brokering the deal was a conflict of interest.
""We will take legal action against the publication of the audios.
""The audios were taken out of context. I was just trying to help the president (Rubiales) have a formula that was financially logical for the FA and the clubs. Commercial issues have nothing to do with sporting ones.""
The Spanish FA took a similar stance.
""We don't understand how such a clear, positive and clean operation becomes a source of controversy. We all know that there is nothing illegal here,"" the Spanish FA's head of communications Pablo Garcia Cuervo told Cadena Ser on Tuesday.
""Pique is a businessman who has an agency that operates internationally with major events and has great contacts. All he did was put us in contact with Saudi Arabia. That is no conflict of interest, he just helped Spanish football to close an extraordinary operation.”
The decision to relocate the Spanish Super Cup to Saudi Arabia has been criticised by many due to the Middle East country's human rights record.
Amnesty International called on the clubs involved in the tournament to take a stand over women's rights and equality issues but had no response.
Saudi Arabia has no codified legal system and no laws regarding sexual orientation or gender identity. Judges have convicted people for ""immorality"", having sexual relations outside of marriage, and homosexual sex.
At the Saudi Grand Prix in December, seven-times Formula One  world champion Lewis Hamilton wore a rainbow-coloured Progress Pride helmet to draw attention to LGBTQ+ intolerance in the country.

""It is embarrassing, it is disappointing, maybe even humiliating,"" said Rangnick.

154,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/brazil-play-argentina-melbourne-cricket-ground-2635036,Brazil to play Argentina at Melbourne Cricket Ground,"SYDNEY :     Brazil and Argentina will meet in a friendly international at Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) in June, five years after the South American powerhouses attracted 95,000 fans to the venue, the Victorian state government said on Wednesday. 
State sports minister Martin Pakula said his understanding was that the big name players from both countries would feature in the June 11 clash.
""Our expectation, based on the discussions we've had, is that players like (Lionel) Messi and Neymar will be here,"" he told Melbourne's 3AW radio station.
""We can't be 100 per cent certain about that but we've been told this is an important preparation for them in the lead up to the World Cup.""
Neymar was left out of the Brazil team for the 2017 clash at the MCG but seven-times Ballon D'Or winner Messi featured in the 1-0 victory for Argentina.
Neymar and Messi's former club Barcelona are also making the trip Down Under this year for a May 25 friendly against an A-League All Stars team in Sydney. 
Australia was a regular off-season stop for major football teams before the country was locked down during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Manchester United and fellow English Premier League club Crystal Palace will also play friendlies at the MCG in July.
Formula One Grand Prix racing returned to Melbourne for the first time since the start of the pandemic earlier this month, while the city also hosts the only Grand Slam tennis tournament in the Asia-Pacific, the Australian Open.  
""To have two of the most successful football teams in the world return to the MCG to continue their longstanding rivalry reinforces our position as one of the world's great sporting cities,"" Pakula said.

Former Liverpool chairman Broughton's consortium includes World Athletics President Sebastian Coe and wealthy investors from around the world, who the group says all want to maintain Chelsea's top status.
Private equity veterans Josh Harris and David Blitzer, who own sport teams including the National Basketball Association's Philadelphia 76ers, are also backing Broughton's bid.
Williams and Hamilton have pledged an estimated 10 million pounds (US$13.06 million) each to the bid, Sky Sports reported.
Hamilton's representatives later confirmed that the 37-year-old had joined Broughton's bid, but said the financial figures quoted in the report were not accurate, without disclosing any details.
Reuters have reached out Williams' representatives for comment.
Williams is already an investor in Los Angeles' Angel City FC, which plays in the National Women's Soccer League.
Final bids for the club, which was put up for sale by owner Roman Abramovich following Russia's invasion of Ukraine before sanctions were imposed on the oligarch by the British government, were submitted earlier this month.
Others on the shortlist to buy the English premiership club are LA Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly and Boston Celtics co-owner Steve Pagliuca.
A consortium led by Chicago Cubs owners the Ricketts family pulled out of the running.
The club's sale is being overseen by US bank Raine Group.","['153_0', '153_1', '153_2']","[""\n      FILE PHOTO: Tennis - Wimbledon - All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, London, Britain - Jun 29, 2021.

Lap distance: 4.909km. Total distance: 309.049km (63 laps)
2021 winner: Max Verstappen(Netherlands) Red Bull 
2021 pole: Lewis Hamilton (Britain) Mercedes One minute 14.411 seconds 
2021 fastest race lap: Hamilton, 1:16.702 
Race lap record: Hamilton (Britain) Mercedes 1:15.484 (2020)
Start time: 1300GMT (1500 local)
IMOLA
The race, at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari, is named after the surrounding region for the third time. It has previously been designated the Italian Grand Prix and San Marino Grand Prix.
This time it will be in the sprint format, with pole decided on Friday for a 100km race on Saturday that then defines the starting grid for Sunday. 
Anti-clockwise Imola hosted the 1980 Italian Grand Prix and then from 1981 became home to the San Marino Grand Prix until 2006, when seven times world champion Michael Schumacher won for a record seventh time.
Sunday will be the 30th F1 world championship race held at the circuit.
Brazilian triple world champion Ayrton Senna and Austrian Roland Ratzenberger died in accidents over the 1994 race weekend.
The circuit is fast, bumpy and quite narrow, making overtaking tricky.
Hamilton (2020), Verstappen and Alpine's Fernando Alonso (Renault, 2005) are the only current drivers to have won at Imola.
In the 29 races to date at Imola, only nine have been won from pole. Another nine winners have come from second on the starting grid. No winner has started lower than fifth.
RACE WINS
Hamilton has a record 103 career victories from 291 starts, the most recent being in Saudi Arabia last December.
Ferrari have won 240 races since 1950, McLaren 183, Mercedes 124, Williams 114 and Red Bull 76.
Ferrari's Charles Leclerc has won two of three races so far this season.
POLE POSITION
Hamilton has a record 103 career poles, most recently qualifying fastest in Saudi Arabia last year.
Leclerc has been on pole twice this year, with Red Bull's Sergio Perez taking the other. 
Red Bull and Ferrari are the only teams to have got both cars into the final phase of qualifying at every race so far this season.
FASTEST LAP
Leclerc has won the fastest lap bonus point in every race so far this year.
POINTS
Leclerc is 34 points clear in the championship, a bigger margin than any driver enjoyed at any stage of last year's battle.
The Saturday Sprint now offers points for the top eight, instead of top three.

151,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/united-look-return-youth-under-ten-hag-2639371,United look to return to youth under Ten Hag,"MANCHESTER, England: Manchester United appointed a new manager in Dutchman Erik ten Hag on Thursday with some very familiar language used to announce his arrival from Ajax.
""During the past four years at Ajax, Erik has proved himself to be one of the most exciting and successful coaches in Europe, renowned for his team’s attractive, attacking football and commitment to youth,"" said United's football director John Murtough.
It is the same rhetoric that former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer frequently turned to when talking about United's 'DNA' - attacking football and youth are seen by the club's hierarchy as embedded in the club's ethos from the days of Matt Busby to Alex Ferguson.
The 'Busby Babes' of the 1950's established United as a post-war power in English football before their progress was wrecked by the Munich air disaster.
The 'Class of 92' under Ferguson created an era of domination of the English game out of a team which won the FA Youth Cup in 1992 and went on to win the Champions League as part of a treble of trophies in 1999.
Ajax are likewise known for a production line of young players and for a commitment to aesthetically pleasing, positive football and by poaching their manager, United clearly hope to tap into that tradition.
United are rightly proud of their record of producing homegrown talent - in 2019 they celebrated 4000 straight matches in which at least one youth graduate was represented in the first team or matchday squad, a run which goes back nine decades to before World War Two.
Even in the midst of their current troubles, placed sixth in the league and beaten 4-0 by Liverpool on Tuesday, the club can point to the success of reaching a record 15th FA Youth Cup final - they will face Nottingham Forest at Old Trafford on May 11.
United have not come close to winning the league since Ferguson retired in 2013 and understandably there is a strong desire to recreate the formula for success that the Scotsman found from academy products such as David Beckham and Paul Scholes.
But cases of success coming from a single generation of youth team players are extremely rare in the modern game and United would be wise to recall another skill of Ferguson's - buying young talent from other clubs.
Wayne Rooney was just 18 when Ferguson signed him from Everton, Roy Keane was 21 when he moved to Old Trafford from Nottingham Forest and Rio Ferdinand 23 when he signed from Leeds United.
Although Ten Hag's Ajax team, currently top of the Dutch table, features some homegrown talent, the core of his side has been bought from elsewhere and that is likely to be the path that United go down as they look at a rebuild ahead of next season.
It would be no surprise if some United academy products find themselves with opportunities next season - winger Anthony Elanga has been given chances under Ralf Rangnick this season, central midfielder James Garner has impressed on loan at Nottingham Forest and Spanish born winger Alejandro Garnacho is also highly rated.
But if United are going to rebuild successfully with younger players next season, they will likely need to provide Ten Hag with hungry talent, proven at a high level.
Some of the players that have been linked with United in media speculation certainly fit that profile with Borussia Dortmund's Jude Bellingham (18) and West Ham United's Declan Rice (23) both options for midfield.
Benfica's 22-year-old striker Darwin Nunez has impressed many in the Champions League this season and United's defence could also benefit from some younger, faster options.
There should be plenty of space for new faces with Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard, Juan Mata and Edinson Cavani all seeing their contracts expire on Jun 30 while Nemanja Matic has confirmed he will leave the club.",['151_0'],"['\nFILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Champions League - Group C - Borussia Dortmund v Ajax Amsterdam - Signal Iduna Park, Dortmund, Germany - November 3, 2021 Ajax Amsterdam coach Erik ten Hag celebrates after the match REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay/File Photo\n']"
150,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/leclerc-fully-focused-imola-despite-watch-theft-2639601,Leclerc fully focused on Imola despite watch theft,"IMOLA, Italy :     Ferrari's Formula One championship leader Charles Leclerc said  he was fully focused on his Italian team's Imola homecoming this weekend despite being robbed of a watch potentially worth millions.
The 24-year-old Monegasque, winner of two of the first three races, had his exclusive Richard Mille timepiece stolen off his wrist in the Italian seaside resort of Viareggio on Monday night.
""I won't go too much into details. It hasn't been a great experience. I cannot say much more than that,"" Leclerc told reporters at Imola on Thursday.
""Everything is going on with the police and they are trying to find them.
""It hasn't been as smooth as what I have read but overall, I am fine and fully focused for the weekend. It won't hurt me for this weekend.""
Edoardo Cetola, head of Carabinieri in Viareggio investigating the robbery, told Reuters there were currently no suspects.
""We are checking the video surveillance cameras to re-construct all the phases of the robbery and find important clues for the investigation,"" he added.
A similar Richard Mille RM 67-02 Charles Leclerc watch was sold last year for 2.1 million Swiss francs ($2.20 million), according to the italianwatchspotter.com website.
Swiss watchmaker Richard Mille is a Ferrari sponsor and Leclerc has worn his watch, which carries his initials, on the  podium.
An investigative source said Leclerc had been in Viareggio with trainer Andrea Ferrari, who comes from the city, driving a black Ferrari 488.
The robbery took place when the Formula One driver was  approached by two people wearing scooter helmets who asked for a selfie after he had dropped the trainer off at his home.
The source said Leclerc tried to give chase in his car but could not follow the scooter.
McLaren's Lando Norris, who had a 40,000 pound ($52,140) Richard Mille watch stolen at Wembley Stadium last year during the Euro 2020 soccer final between England and Italy, commiserated with Leclerc by text.
""I messaged him as soon as I saw the news,"" he told Reuters.
""When I go to events now I organise it better, in the safest way possible,"" said the Briton, whose watch has yet to be recovered. ""At times you forget about these things that can happen.
""There's only so much you can do because you still want to lead a normal life and be able to walk down the street.""

Red Bull's reigning world champion Max Verstappen was third fastest with a time of 1:30.867, followed by the two Haas drivers Kevin Magnussen and Mick Schumacher, one of several spinners.
Red Bull's Sergio Perez was sixth fastest. 
Seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton was only 18th in a session that started with full wet tyres before conditions improved enough for some to venture out on intermediates.
Team mate George Russell, second in the standings but 34 points adrift of Leclerc, was in 10th place on a difficult afternoon for the champion constructors and more than four seconds off the pace.
Hamilton was seven seconds adrift of Leclerc. 
""This is all about getting grip into the tyre and the temperature,"" said team boss Toto Wolff. ""The Ferraris appear to have unlocked this thing and everybody else is pretty much all over the place.
""Certainly when you see your car pounding around five seconds off the pace, you want to strangle yourself. But I enjoy the challenge and I enjoy it being bad - because in the long run we're going to be good.""  
McLaren's Lando Norris brought out red flags five minutes from the end when he locked up at Acque Minerali and went into the gravel before getting back on track.
Imola is the first European race of the season and also the first of three in the sprint format, with qualifying later on Friday to decide the starting grid for a 100km race on Saturday that establishes the order for Sunday's main event.
In a change from last season, the official pole position for the Formula One record books will be awarded on Friday rather than Saturday.

Ferrari's championship leader Charles Leclerc, thwarted by a late stoppage, will line up alongside the Dutchman on the front row for Saturday's 100km race to decide who starts first in Sunday's main grand prix at Imola.
Verstappen goes into the F1 record books as the pole-setter for the weekend, however, regardless of where he starts on Sunday.
The winner of the sprint will take eight points instead of the three available at each of last season's three such weekends.
Leclerc has a 34 point lead over Mercedes' George Russell in the championship after winning two of the three rounds to date and taking all three bonus points available for fastest laps.
Each of Friday's three qualifying phases had to be halted after incidents, with the red flags brought out five times in total and the pole contenders ultimately splashing around on intermediate tyres and with plumes of spray.
The final one, triggered by McLaren's Lando Norris becoming stuck in the gravel run-off, brought an end to the proceedings with 38 seconds remaining and the Briton qualifying a strong third.
Kevin Magnussen was fourth for Haas, ahead of Alpine's Fernando Alonso and McLaren's Daniel Ricciardo with Red Bull's Sergio Perez seventh and Valtteri Bottas eighth for Alfa Romeo. Sebastian Vettel starts ninth for Aston Martin.
Verstappen's best time of 1 minute 27.999 seconds was 0.779 quicker than Leclerc's quickest, although the final session was interrupted three times.
Carlos Sainz had already spun and smashed his Ferrari into the tyre barrier in the second stint, bringing out red flags and sending the Spaniard back to the paddock on a scooter. He qualified 10th.
Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton had scraped into that phase by the skin of his teeth, the seven-time world champion only 15th and just 0.004 of a second quicker than AlphaTauri's Yuki Tsunoda on a drying track.
Russell also ran dangerously close to missing the early cut, and both then failed to make the final top 10, the first time that had happened to the team since 2012.
Leclerc had been fastest in Q1, before the rain came, and ahead of Verstappen and Sainz. The Monegasque driver had also set the pace in practice.
Alex Albon failed to set a time after the right rear brake of his Williams caught fire with the tyre then exploding, scattering flaming debris on the track and bringing out red flags.

""There are things that we should have done that we didn't do,"" he added.
Hamilton said that Mercedes had arrived with optimism, and recognised the hard work being done back at the factory, but ""things just don't come together"".
""We will work as hard as we can to move up in the sprint race, it is going to be hard, but maybe the weather will improve and we can do better,"" he added after a rain-hit session punctuated by crashes and red flags.

Mercedes failed to get either of their cars into the top 10 in Friday's wet qualifying, the first time that had happened since 2012.
Some saw Saturday's session, with Mercedes on top for the first time this season, as more indicative of the team doing performance runs in dry conditions rather than finding any significant solutions.

The Dutch driver had already secured the official pole for the record books in a wet Friday qualifying for the sprint but Saturday's result made that concrete as well as bagging him eight points.
Leclerc had seized the lead at the start, and held it through an initial safety car period, before Verstappen made up for his poor getaway and passed the Monegasque - whose tyres were fading fast - with a late move around the outside.
Ferrari's Carlos Sainz moved up to second in the championship standings after racing from 10th place to fourth, behind Red Bull's Sergio Perez, in the 100km race over 21 laps at Imola.
Verstappen, who retired in the first two races of the season, is now 45 points behind Leclerc.
The first sprint of the season saw points awarded to the top eight, rather than podium places as was the case last year.
McLaren's Lando Norris and Daniel Ricciardo finished fifth and sixth with Valtteri Bottas seventh for Alfa Romeo and Kevin Magnussen banking the final point for Haas after starting in fourth place.
""My start was not very good and it took a while to try and put the pressure on,"" said Verstappen, who made his move two laps from the end.
""We were a bit better on our tyres at the end of the race so I could get into DRS (drag reduction system) and we had a good fight into turn two.""
Leclerc said it had been a struggle with the tyre degradation at the end but was confident Ferrari would come back stronger on Sunday in front of their army of red-shirted home 'tifosi'.
Champions Mercedes had an afternoon to forget, with George Russell finishing 11th and losing second place in the standings while seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton was 14th - one place lower than where he started.
Magnussen's Haas team mate Mick Schumacher ensured he starts in 10th place, with a chance of securing his first point.
The safety car was brought out on lap two when Alfa Romeo's Chinese rookie Guanyu Zhou and Alpha Tauri's Pierre Gasly got in a tangle.

""I am optimistic they (the teams) will all see the value in it and what we are giving the fans. What we should remember about the sprint is it gives you a great Friday as well,"" added the Briton.
""You have qualifying on the Friday, we have three days of action for the fans and we cannot ignore that.""
Brawn said it was more important to agree the number of races than discuss any change to a format that some still have reservations about.
Last year's sprint races offered points for the top three finishers only but that has now been extended to the first eight.
The Briton said that move had made the Saturday action, which decides the grid for Sunday's grand prix, more attractive through the field.
""I think what I would like to do is at least get six races settled and then after these three races, we can see if there are format developments we want to do but I would like to just move on to six races,"" he said.
""The six races need to pass on a simple majority (vote), any format changes in the future would have to pass on a super majority, so eight teams would have to agree. So I think the important thing is to get the simple thing done first.""

140,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/hamilton-still-100-committed-mercedes-2644411,Hamilton still 100% committed to Mercedes,"IMOLA, Italy :     Seven times Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton has dismissed as ""a bunch of nonsense"" speculation about his future and said he remains fully committed to Mercedes despite receding title hopes.
The 37-year-old Briton was 50 points adrift of Ferrari's  Charles Leclerc after Saturday's Emilia Romagna sprint race, with that gulf set to widen further after only four of the season's 23 races.
Mercedes are struggling with a ""porpoising"" car that bounces on the straights as aerodynamic downforce is gained and lost, and Hamilton qualified only 14th for Sunday's main race at Imola.
Asked whether he would see out his contract, which runs to the end of next year, Hamilton said such comments were silly.
""I am 100 per cent committed to this team. There’s nowhere else that I want to be. Just because we’ve hit a rough patch, it’s just not in my DNA to back out,"" he told reporters.
""We are still world champions and we can fix this. It’s just going to take longer, it’s going to take a painful year. 
""I think, ultimately, this is going to be a painful year that we’re going to have to ride out together with belief that we can rectify it at some point, maybe through the year or even the worst case scenario, at least for next year.""
Hamilton said his current Mercedes was one of the worst he had driven in Formula One.
""There are people that watch and say that I've never had a bad car. And I can assure you I have. The 2009 (McLaren) car was very, very far off, and was the worst car that I've had,"" he said.
""This car currently is not far off that experience, but I think has a lot of potential, as did that car. We fixed it eventually and got back in the fight, or in the game. And I have the utmost faith that my team can do that here, too.""
Hamilton, who won his first title with McLaren in 2008, failed to reach the podium in the opening nine races of 2009 before winning in Hungary.
Then, as now, Formula One underwent a rules revolution and Brawn GP stunned the field with a radical interpretation.
""It was a brand new era of car and I remember coming back in February, or January, to the team, and the head aerodynamicists and team guys at the top were like 'Oh, we've already hit our target’,"" said Hamilton.
""The new rules said we would have 50 per cent less downforce in 2009, so they designed the car to have 50 per cent less... Then obviously we got to the first test and realised that others had almost as much downforce as the previous year.""
Hamilton said the current situation was different with Mercedes wrong-footed by what the wind tunnel was telling them and the reality of the car bouncing on track.
""This experience is a lot harder to fix than we could have ever imagined,"" he said.

Verstappen became the first Dutch driver to win the world championship when he clinched his maiden crown by beating seven-times winner Lewis Hamilton on the final lap of the last race of the 2021 season in Abu Dhabi in December.
""Since I was a little kid, I dreamt of being on the top step and winning the championship,"" the 24-year-old Verstappen said. 
""The reaction back in Holland was amazing from all the newspapers and fans. It's something we'll never forget.
""It was a lot of hard work and years of preparation. I'm incredibly proud... It means a lot to be recognised for this award, one of the highest ones in the world, so I'm incredibly happy.""
Jamaica's Thompson-Herah became the first woman to win back-to-back Olympic sprint doubles when she retained her 100m and 200m titles in Tokyo last year and capped a memorable Games with gold in the 4x100m relay.
""I know Usain (Bolt) has won Laureus Awards before, so to bring this trophy back home to the Caribbean, also in Jamaica, is very special,"" Thompson-Herah said.
""I have watched that (100m) race about a thousand times now. I would say I am very, very proud, but I cannot dwell on the past... My motivation is to be even better. I told myself that I want to be the greatest female sprinter.""
Italy's soccer team were named Team of the Year for the second time after winning the 2020 European Championship, having previously received the honour after winning the World Cup in 2006.

Norris finished 15th in Bahrain while Australian team mate Daniel Ricciardo was 14th after running last at the end of the opening lap, but McLaren have been improving steadily since then.
""I genuinely didn't think we would be on the podium all year after Bahrain. So it’s quite a shock,"" the Briton, who has now scored points in his last three races, told reporters after finishing third at Imola.
""Maybe not surprising after the kind of progress we’ve made over the last month but yeah, definitely not a podium you know, with how much quicker the Red Bulls and the Ferraris are.""
Norris was also third at last year's Emilia Romagna Grand Prix and Sunday's conditions, initially wet but with the track drying, suited him.
He had also started third after a strong showing in Saturday's points-paying sprint race.
Asked whether he felt he had the third fastest car, Norris poked fun at friend and Mercedes rival George Russell whom he has accused of playing down his car's speed to make himself look good.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen, another friend, advised him to talk himself up.
""You should say it’s all the driver, mate. All the driver,"" said the world champion and race winner.
""It is,"" replied Norris.
""You had the worst car,"" exclaimed Verstappen, getting into the spirit.
""Yeah, we’re ninth or tenth but my driving this weekend has been pretty amazing,"" said Norris, who felt his car had been slightly quicker than Russell's fourth-placed Mercedes but maybe slower than the Alfa Romeo.
""It doesn't really matter: we beat two cars who are probably a second a lap quicker than us,"" he added, referring to the Ferraris of Carlos Sainz and championship leader Charles Leclerc.
Sainz went off on lap one and Leclerc was sixth after a spin while chasing second place.
""One ended up in the wall and one ended up in the gravel ... I think we just executed a great race from our side.

The Briton finished 13th in the fourth round of the season and was lapped by Red Bull's world champion race winner Max Verstappen.
Mercedes team mate George Russell's fourth place after the Imola sprint weekend also put Hamilton's seeming loss of form into question as much as the car's performance.
""I have to protect him. It’s not his low,"" Wolff, whose team failed to make it to the final stage of qualifying for the first time in a decade, told reporters. ""It’s the low of the car performance.
""The guy is the best driver in the world and he is not having a machine and equipment underneath him to be able to execute,"" added the Austrian.
""In a way it is even irrelevant whether you come eighth, 12th, 15th, doesn’t matter, it’s all bad.""
Hamilton is now seventh overall, already 58 points behind Ferrari's leader Charles Leclerc and with his title hopes in tatters.
Wolff said the true greats all had difficult moments in their careers and overcame them, and Hamilton, winner of a record 103 races, would do so too.
""He’s going to help the team to sort themselves out and we are sticking together through good and bad times and today certainly was a very bad day,"" he added.
Wolff apologised to Hamilton over the team radio after the race, saying Mercedes had not provided a car worthy of a champion and they would fix it.
How they do that remains to be seen.
The car suffers from 'porpoising' more than others, a fundamental problem arising from new rules that makes it bounce on the straights as aerodynamic downforce is gained and broken.
Wolff said the team still hoped they could unlock the 'aerodynamic goodness"" but recognised they might also have to go back to the drawing board.
""You don’t need to throw away the goodness, but if there are fundamental areas that don’t allow us to unlock the potential that we believe is in the car, then you need to cut your losses,"" he said.
""It would mean you say 'where is the baseline now?'. Is there a new one we can start on where we believe we can unlock more potential?
""If we thought that, we would have done it five months ago. We believed this was the development line we needed to take. So it is quite a tricky exercise.""
Verstappen, who denied Hamilton a record eighth title last season, was brutally honest about how it felt to lap the sport's most successful driver.
""They've been slow all year, so it's not really a surprise or I feel happy lapping Lewis compared to anyone else,"" said the Dutch driver.","['137_0', '137_1']","[""\n      A fan takes a selfie with Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton after the race.

World champion Verstappen, who had to retire in Australia two weeks ago, could not have taken a bigger haul from the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix with pole and victories in the Saturday sprint and Sunday's race plus fastest lap.
Mexican team mate Sergio Perez finished third on Saturday and second on Sunday to leave Red Bull only a point short of the maximum 59 and the title battle looking even more two dimensional.
""It was just the rebound we needed,"" team boss Christian Horner told reporters after a result that left Verstappen 27 points adrift of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, who spun and finished sixth.
Verstappen had been 46 behind after his retirement from second place in Australia due to a fuel system problem.
""We attacked the weekend from the word go and both drivers have been unbelievable. Both Max and Checo (Perez) have driven brilliantly this weekend,"" said Horner.
""After the disappointment of Australia to come back with a result like that here at Imola was one of our best ever results.
""You can never say never but I think obviously its demonstrated that we’ve managed to get on top of the issue from Australia.""
The win meant Verstappen and Leclerc, also 24, each have two wins from the first four rounds of a record 23-race season and are the clear contenders standing out from the rest.
The Ferrari driver remains well ahead, however, because Verstappen has also had two retirements due to mechanical issues.
""It’s so early in the championship there’s going to be swings and roundabouts, but obviously the DNFs (non-finishes) have been costly,"" said Horner.
""We’ve done it in both championship tables so we’ll take that out of this weekend and try and build on it in Miami at a new circuit in a couple of weeks' time.
""Ferrari have got a great car and great drivers. They’ve been unlucky at this race, but for sure they are going to be super-competitive in two weeks' time. I think it will be like that for the whole season.""

135,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/f1-teams-strip-paint-go-faster-2649106,F1 teams strip off the paint to go faster,"LONDON: Formula One teams seeking to go faster have been stripping paint from the cars they revealed with pride before the season started.
McLaren, Aston Martin and Williams were among those at last weekend's Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in Imola with notable expanses of raw, black carbon fibre replacing previously liveried areas.
New rules for 2022, with the introduction of larger wheels and an increased use of standard parts, have left some struggling to get down to a new minimum weight limit of 798kg.
Every excess 10kg translates into about 0.3 seconds of lost time per lap.
""With the halo, the bigger tyres, the longer cars, we were all overweight. I think all but maybe one team,"" McLaren boss Zak Brown told Reuters.
""When you’re overweight you do everything you can to save anything you can. And it’s all incremental.""
Brown said some sponsorship deals, such as McLaren's with Google's Android, had accelerated the process of stripping paint.
""Our engine cover was initially papaya but that was before we landed Google as a partner. We took the opportunity: “Hey, you want black? Fantastic’,"" he said.
""We didn’t modify anything that wasn’t kind of in line with our brand or what a partner wanted. But it saved some weight. Not a lot but it’s about finding a little bit in a lot of different places.""
Saving weight by going back to bare metal, or carbon fibre, has a long history in motor racing.
According to lore, the original 1930s Mercedes 'Silver Arrows' acquired their nickname when the cars raced with bare aluminium bodies after the team removed lead-based paint to shave off a kilo and come in under a maximum weight.
The paint on a Formula One car weighs around 6kg, according to Alfa Romeo team manager Beat Zehnder.
Aston Martin's technical head Andrew Green said last month that removing some of his car's green paint had saved 350g.
Back in 2016, McLaren sponsor AkzoNobel said painting each car involved six litres of paint and three litres of gloss lacquer totalling more than eight square metres of painted surface.
Dave Robson, Williams's head of vehicle performance, was reluctant to quantify the exact gain from removing paint but said it was 'meaningful'.
""The paint might be light but to get a good finish you end up doing quite a lot of filler work and prep on the bare carbon before you put the paint on,"" he said.
Robson said stripping off paint was the fastest way to remove weight and even if a car was below the limit it was still beneficial to have an extra saving so the team could add ballast to improve balance.
""It will be expensive and time consuming to find the weight (saving) some other way,"" he said, indicating the bare look was set to stay even if marketing departments were less happy.
""The car has to have some visible personality but at the same time it's in the sponsors' interests to make it as quick as possible.""",['135_0'],"[""\nMcLaren's Lando Norris during the race. (Photo: REUTERS/Jennifer Lorenzini)\n""]"

The world body said in a statement that the proposal was to use the same format as this season, with points awarded to the top eight in the 100km Saturday sprint, but it reserved judgement.
""While supporting the principle of an increased number of sprint events, the FIA is still evaluating the impact of this proposal on its trackside operations and personnel, and will provide its feedback to the commission,"" it added.
The meeting was chaired by FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem and sources said the governing body wanted a financial contribution from Formula One. There was no immediate comment from the FIA.
A super-majority is required for the change to take effect next year and the FIA hold a third of the votes on the commission.
The first sprint of this season was held at Imola in Italy at the weekend, with Formula One's managing director Ross Brawn spelling out the desire for more after the format was first trialled in 2021.
""I think what I would like to do is at least get six races settled and then after these three races we can see if there are format developments we want to do,"" he told reporters at Imola on Saturday. ""But I would like to just move on to six races.""
The sprint format sees qualifying for the official pole position on Friday, with Saturday's race setting the grid for Sunday's grand prix.
The other two sprints this year will be held in Austria and Brazil.
The FIA also set targets for aerodynamic regulations related to the introduction of a new power unit from 2026.
The targets are to reduce drag significantly to offset any reduction in power, increase sustainability with more standardised or simplified components, further develop close racing and make the cars smaller and lighter.
Helmet cameras, trialled recently, were deemed a success and it was unanimously agreed to update next year's technical regulations to mandate their use for all drivers.
The commission also unanimously agreed to trial a reduction in the tyre allocation from 13 sets to 11 at two events next season as part of an intended move to more sustainable use in future.
The cost cap and the pressures of rising inflation were also discussed, with the sport's financial working group to put forward proposals.
There was no word on a replacement for the Russian Grand Prix, which was cancelled after the country's invasion of Ukraine. Russia calls its military action a 'special operation'

The American said his team were the biggest buyers of hospitality for the May 8 race around the Hard Rock Stadium, home of the NFL's Miami Dolphins, but demand far outstripped supply.
""It's going to be awesome. I've been here six years and I've never seen demand or buzz for a grand prix like I've seen for Miami,"" Brown, whose background is in sponsorship and marketing, told Reuters.
""We can easily double our hospitality and we're already the largest hospitality buyer in Miami ... it rivals the Super Bowl as far as 'are you going to the Miami race?'.
""I've been around F1 for 20 years and I'm used to going to grands prix but I've never seen anything like it.""
The race is the fifth round of the season and, with the long-established race in Austin, Texas, one of two in the United States this year. In 2023 there will be three with Las Vegas debuting.
Brown said McLaren had 1,000 guests, including A-list celebrities, coming over the course of the weekend and would have a McLaren House as well as Paddock Club hospitality and grandstands.
""Having been around the Super Bowl, where there's the football game and then there's the halftime celebs and shows, this feels like the Super Bowl,"" he said.
The Miami metropolitan area has hosted Super Bowl 11 times, more than anywhere else, with six of them at the Hard Rock Stadium and the most recent in 2020.
Austin drew the biggest F1 crowd of the season last year, with a total three-day attendance of 400,000, and Brown said the Texas track had played a big role in building the sport's popularity in a region of key importance to Formula One.
So too had the acclaimed Netflix docu-series 'Drive to Survive', credited with bringing in new and younger audiences to a championship that once struggled for air time in a market dominated by US sports.
Brown said he saw no sign of the bubble bursting.
""Now you've got Vegas the sport's never been healthier and more exciting,"" he said.
""If you look at the corporate partners on our car, half of our car are US-based companies. So US-based companies are now actually starting to get behind it. I think we've got a long way to go.""
The American also played down failed legal attempts by some local Miami Gardens residents to try and stop the race on grounds of disruption and physical harm from noise levels.
""Welcome to America,"" he said. ""The headline I saw was kind of people are afraid they are going to go deaf. I don't even have headphones on in the garage.
""The amount of exposure and economics that's going to be brought to Miami ... is going to be a far greater contribution to a much larger audience than X number of people that don't want to hear the sound and probably never heard a Formula One car.""",['133_0'],['\nMcLaren Chief Executive Officer Zak Brown arrives at the circuit ahead of the Grand Prix.

The single-seater championship, which uses F3 cars and partnered with Formula One in 2021, has expanded to 10 races and announced this week a multi-year live coverage deal with Britain's Sky Sports pay television.
The season starts with back-to-back races at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium.
""Unquestionably Miami is going to be the biggest race we’ve had,"" Bond Muir told Reuters.
""The incoming commercial interest, and also the incoming media interest, is just like nothing we’ve had before.
""COTA (Austin's Circuit of the Americas) last year was a great entrance into the (US) market but hopefully Miami will be a springboard to significant more interest.""
F1 broadcaster Sky has promised to promote the series, which will also remain available free-to-air as a highlights package on Channel Four, across its platforms and to create role models for young women.
""It’s very important to us. We want to use our voice and drive positive change in society but we want to inspire,"" Sky's director of Formula One Billy McGinty told Reuters after female presenters led its Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix weekend.
""We really believe that we have to be representative of our audience and society in general.""
Formula One has not had a woman start a race since Italian Lella Lombardi in 1976 and W Series was founded with a mission to help a female racer reach the top.
Britain's Jamie Chadwick won the first two titles and the Williams development driver is returning for a third year after failing to secure a seat alongside the men higher up the motorsport ladder.
""I do believe that Jamie will get into Formula Three, Formula Two,"" said Bond Muir. ""I don’t know, but I do believe.

Mercedes have been wrestling with the 'porpoising' problem since the start of the season, with seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton already 58 points behind Ferrari's Charles Leclerc after four races.
Hamilton finished 13th in last Sunday's Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola.
Shovlin said in a debrief on the team's YouTube channel that the problem posed new engineering challenges that Mercedes needed to understand.
""Hopefully soon, maybe as soon as Miami, we can start to bring some parts to the car that will hopefully give us an indication on whether we are moving in the right direction,"" he said.
""We are not expecting to solve this overnight, but if we can get a clue that we are going in the right direction, that we really got to the bottom of what is going on, then we will be quite pleased that we are just moving on the right path.""
The bouncing problem has forced the team, now third in the standings, to run their car higher than planned which affects  aerodynamic performance.
Shovlin said a lot of the work being done at the factory was to understand the phenomenon and see whether there was an aerodynamic solution to make it go away.
""Being realistic, we think this will be something we approach in steps rather than one big moment where the whole thing vanishes,"" he added.
""But we are seeing encouraging signs... we are hoping to bring parts to the car soon, maybe even Miami where we can hopefully see progress on this issue.""

Chelsea were put up for sale by owner Roman Abramovich in March following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and before sanctions were imposed on the oligarch by the British government.
American bank Raine is handling the sale, and the spokesperson for Pagliuca's group said they had been told by the bank that they were not the ""preferred bidder"" so were out of contention. Raine were not immediately reachable for comment.
Pagliuca had teamed up with NBA chairman Larry Tanenbaum, who is owner of the Canadian company Maple Leaf Sports Entertainment, which owns a number of professional sports franchises in Toronto.

Jaguar's Mitch Evans was second in the sixth round of the season and double Formula E champion Jean-Eric Vergne finished third for DS Techeetah in front of a crowd of more than 15,000.
""It is an amazing feeling,"" said former McLaren Formula One driver Vandoorne after his third career Formula E win and Mercedes' second of the current campaign.
""Monaco is always a special race to win as a driver. Last year we had a tough time here, this year we managed to turn it around.
""The target was to qualify at the front and then I knew we would be in the mix, and that is exactly how the race panned out,"" added the Belgian, who had not won since Rome in April last year.
Evans, winner of the two previous races in Rome, started from pole position but lost out after a race-long battle with Vandoorne.
Vergne remains the only driver to have scored in every race this season.
Vandoorne now has 81 points to Vergne's 75 and Evans' 72, with Mercedes leading the team standings on 120 points to DS Techeetah's haul of 105. 
The next round is a double-header in Berlin on May 14 and 15, marking the midpoint of season eight.

""I was saddened to hear the news that Tony Brooks has died,"" said Formula One chief executive Stefano Domenicali in a statement.
""He was part of a special group of drivers who were pioneers and pushed the boundaries at a time of great risk.""
The BBC said the news was announced by Brooks' daughter Giulia.
Charles Anthony Standish Brooks, known as Tony, won six grands prix during one of the sport's deadliest eras, making his championship debut with BRM in 1956 and retiring in 1961 at the age of 29.
He also drove for Vanwall, Ferrari and Cooper.
""Brooks was a tremendous driver, the greatest - if he'll forgive me saying this - 'unknown' racing driver there's ever been,"" late compatriot Stirling Moss told writer Nigel Roebuck in the 1986 book 'Grand Prix Greats'.
""He was far better than several people who won the world championship.""
The Briton, a keen amateur racer, was a 23-year-old dentistry student at Manchester University preparing for his finals when he won the 1955 non-championship Syracuse Grand Prix in Sicily.
""I was swotting when they (Connaught) rang me, a few days before the race,"" he recalled. ""I had never so much as sat in a Formula One car before but rather absent-mindedly said yes and put the phone down.""
He missed the first day of practice, learnt the track on a hired scooter and beat the factory Maseratis of established F1 drivers Luigi Musso and Luigi Villoresi.
Brooks won the 1957 British Grand Prix for Vanwall, in a car shared with Moss, and triumphed for Ferrari in France and Germany in 1959, the year he finished second overall to Australian Jack Brabham.
He was also twice a runner-up in Monaco.  
Only Argentina's Juan Manuel Fangio, Italian Alberto Ascari and Moss won more races than him in the 1950s.   
""For six or seven years I went motor racing and thoroughly enjoyed it,"" he said. ""But I never had the dedication of, say, Stirling. It was never going to be my life. Just a part of it.""

China is relatively lacking in motorsport culture, but is a key market for Formula One with a rapidly emerging middle class and lure as an attractive market for automakers.
Formula One has also extended its contract with the Chinese Grand Prix until 2025 and there has long been talk of a second race in the country.
""We've been in Shanghai before and couldn't be there the last two years, but this is an important market for us,"" Wolff told Xinhua news agency at the FIA Formula E Championship in Monaco over the weekend.
""I'd like to not only race in Shanghai, I'd also like to race in Beijing. It's a fantastic market for us as Mercedes, and I believe we should be embedded there with a strong footprint.
""We have three races in the United States now - Las Vegas, Miami and Austin - and if we can do the same thing in China, that would be great.""
China's first Formula One driver Guanyu Zhou enjoyed a superb start to his career at the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix in March, as the Alfa Romeo rookie finished in the points on his debut.
Chinese drivers have tested Formula One machinery before with Ma Qing Hua and Dutch-born Ho-Pin Tung, who was reserve for Renault in 2010 in another first.

Westwood's decision comes shortly after British Masters champion Richard Bland said he has requested a release from the DP World Tour, while Phil Mickelson asked the PGA Tour for a similar release last month.
The first LIV Golf Invitational event will be held from June 9-11 at the Centurion Golf Club outside of London. 
""I've put a release in with the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour, as many people have,"" Westwood told Sky Sports. ""That's kind of the stage we're at and anything after that is just ifs and buts and speculation.
""It's an opportunity to play in a big tournament, against some of the best players in the world, in England. 
""I love playing in England in front of home fans, so any time there's an opportunity like that I feel like I should take it.""
The U.S.-based PGA Tour has told its members that they would be banned if they joined the breakaway Saudi-backed league. 
Several top players including Tiger Woods, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas have expressed their allegiance to the PGA Tour, while Rory McIlroy has described the breakaway league as ""dead in the water"".
Westwood said golf has come under scrutiny more than other sports for its links with Saudi Arabia.
""We've played European Tour in Saudi Arabia and I've had releases from the PGA Tour to say I can play in Saudi Arabia, so it has been no problem to them in previous years,"" he added.
""Formula One raced there. Newcastle United are owned partly by people from Saudi Arabia. There has been boxing there and I think there has been snooker and darts there as well.
""Golf's not the first sport to have links with Saudi Arabia, but it seems to be coming under more scrutiny than anyone else. Whether you think that's right or not is the individual's opinion.""
Earlier, Bland told reporters he had asked the DP World Tour for a release but added that he is focused on retaining his title at the British Masters, which will be held at The Belfry from Thursday.

Season nine, which starts in 2023, is the beginning of the Gen3 era, with more powerful and efficient cars and new financial regulations for fairness and sustainability.
ABT, who will take the vacant 12th licence, said it had secured a powertrain supply from an unidentified manufacturer and would compete as a privately-entered team.
""Formula E has always had a big place in our hearts and we have never made a secret of the fact that we want to be back,"" said ABT's Hans-Juergen Abt.

Season four, which aired this year, has featured in Netflix's weekly top 10 in 56 countries, Formula One said in a statement.
Filming for season five, to air next year, is underway with the fifth round of the season taking place in Miami this weekend.
""The new season will once again take fans behind the scenes, to witness first-hand how the drivers and teams prepare to battle it out for the 2022 and 2023 championships,"" Formula One said.
""The series will offer never-before-seen footage and interviews from the sport’s biggest names.""
The race, making its debut, is one of two US rounds on the 2022 calendar with a night race in Las Vegas scheduled for next year.
While the series had proved popular viewing, Red Bull's world champion Max Verstappen is not a fan and did not take part in its fourth season.
Critics say rivalries are manufactured while conversations and radio comments have been placed out of context to liven up the show.

121,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/formula-one-ready-rock-miami-makes-its-debut-2667026,Formula One ready to rock as Miami makes its debut,"    Red Bull's Max Verstappen can take another big bite out of Ferrari rival Charles Leclerc's 27-point lead in Miami this weekend as Formula One gets ready to rock around its newest venue.
The pair have won twice each this season and the fifth round on the fast track laid out around the Hard Rock Stadium, home of the Miami Dolphins NFL team, could see another big battle between the 24-year-old front-runners.
""I think this weekend is going to be pretty crazy,"" said Verstappen, the reigning world champion who won last year's U.S. Grand Prix in Austin, Texas.  
""I love racing in Austin so it’s fun that we get to go to another state and race this year.""
Verstappen was dominant at Imola in Italy two weeks ago when he won a Saturday sprint from pole and led from start to finish on Sunday while also taking a bonus point for the fastest lap.
That slashed Leclerc's lead from a previous 34 points and the Ferrari driver will be keen to hit back strongly after the team failed to live up to expectations in front of their home crowd.
Struggling Mercedes, the team of seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton who finished a lowly 13th at Imola, will be similarly fired up even if they still have somewhat lower expectations.
Hamilton has a great record in America and Mercedes are hoping for clear signs of progress in taming their bouncing car so it can go faster and finally start to reveal its hidden potential.
""Since we returned from Italy, we've learned as much from the weekend as we can and, in parallel, our learning has continued in the wind tunnel and simulations,"" said team boss Toto Wolff.
""We have found several directions for improving the car, and we will be conducting experiments in Miami to correlate those simulations, and hopefully confirm the development path for the coming races.""
McLaren, with Briton Lando Norris on the podium at Imola, and Australian Daniel Ricciardo will also fancy their chances of strong points.
The race is a sellout, with 240,000 expected over the three days and a capacity 82,500 on Sunday with the sport promising a cast of celebrity guests and a Super Bowl-style atmosphere.
In an attempt to capture the Miami vibe, organisers have created a simulated marina with dry-docked yacht and a boarded surface creating the impression of water for the television cameras.
""Miami is going to be an experience for all of us, for the racing community, for the fans out there watching,"" said Hamilton.

120,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/miami-gp-has-no-beach-and-no-water-plenty-buzz-2667281,Miami GP has no beach and no water but plenty of buzz,"MIAMI: Depending on who you listen to, Sunday's (May 8) Miami Grand Prix will either be a Formula One race squeezed into an NFL stadium car park or the much anticipated, inaugural event at the brand-new Miami International Autodrome.
Both descriptions are true and rarely has the American phrase ""Fake it until you make it"" been as appropriate as for F1's debut in South Florida.
The ""campus"", on the grounds of the Miami Dolphins' Hard Rock Stadium, hosts a ""Beach Club"" where there is no beach and, most noticeably of all, a Marina without water.
The ""yacht club"" does boast real yachts, but the impressive vessels sit on concrete blocks above a special vinyl surface designed to look like gently rolling waves for television cameras.
Yet, like pretty much everything created for the race, it somehow seems to work.
The decision to build the track up to an hour's drive away from South Beach or downtown Miami came after organisers were unable to find a way to set up F1 in the heart of the city but they have pulled out the stops to incorporate the ""look and feel"" of the tourist destination.
The venue doesn't feel like a car park at all, packed with 137 tents, 53 hospitality venues, 10 grandstands and, of course, the racetrack itself.
It looks and feels like an F1 race track and should be bustling with noise and atmosphere throughout the weekend.
It won't drive like a ""car park"" race either. Unlike past efforts in parking lots, such as in Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, the Miami track is a properly constructed, hi-tech, F1 surface.
But with DJ's providing the soundtrack when the engines are switched off, top local chefs dishing up the food and celebrities to be spotted, organisers have clearly set out to create an event venue for the corporate set as much as a race circuit.
""It's almost a Disneyland-like campus, with so many opportunities for great experiences with friends, whether that's through music, drinks, all kinds of different things,"" said Tom Garfinkel, managing partner of the Miami GP and CEO of the Miami Dolphins.
Garfinkel believes the way to turn Americans, particularly South Floridians, into F1 fans is to show them a good time and then expose them to the sport.
""When people come out and enjoy those experiences, there's going to be the world's best auto racing going on around them. I think educating them about that auto racing and giving them that experience is going to turn them into Formula 1 fans pretty quickly. F1 sells itself,"" added Garfinkel.
The Dolphins organisation has experience in making the most of its real estate - since 2019 the venue has hosted the Miami Open ATP and WTA masters series tennis tournament.
The stadium itself is expected to be one of the host venues for the 2026 soccer World Cup which will be held in the United States, Mexico and Canada, and local organisers have even been pitching to stage the final.
Critics may question the authenticity of the venue for motor racing, compared to some of the classic racetracks elsewhere in the United States, but in many ways there is something very Miami about the whole venture.
After all, large parts of the city are built on reclaimed land and there is certainly nothing alien to South Floridians about planting palm trees, pointing to yachts and counting up the dollar bills.",['120_0'],"[""\nFormula One F1 - Miami Grand Prix - Miami International Autodrome, Miami, Florida, U.S. - May 5, 2022 Red Bull's mechanics on the pit lane ahead of the Miami Grand Prix REUTERS/Ricardo Arduengo\n""]"

The Mercedes driver spoke after race director Niels Wittich issued a reminder to all teams and officials that wearing body piercings and metal neck chains was prohibited during competition and could be checked.
Hamilton, the sport's most successful driver and biggest name in America, has said he cannot remove some of his piercings.
The 37-year-old said he was prepared to sign a waiver instead to take personal responsibility and suggested all parties had ""bigger fish to fry"".
The Briton emphasised his resistance by wearing rings on every finger, three watches (set to different time zones), a bangle, strings of necklaces and studs in both ears.
A further nose piercing was hidden by his face mask.
""I couldn't get any more jewellery on today,"" he said, adding that he felt the clampdown was almost a backward step at a time when the sport and governing FIA should be focused on its latest big breakthrough in America.
""This is such a small thing,"" he said. ""It seems unnecessary for us to get into this spat.""
Asked what the solution might be to an apparent impasse, Hamilton indicated there was only so much he could do.
""I can't remove at least two of them,"" he said. ""One I can't really explain where it is.
""But what I can say is it's platinum that I have, so it's non-magnetic, it's never been a safety issue in the past. I've had in 16 years so many MRI scans and not had to take out the platinum.
""And if they stop me then so be it. We've got a spare driver ... there's lots to do in the city anyway so I'll be good either way.""
Wittich had explained in his note that the wearing of jewellery underneath the mandatory flameproof clothing could reduce heat transmission protection and increase the risk of burn injuries.
He said it could also hinder medical intervention and treatment due to the risk of 'snagging' when safety equipment such as the helmet, balaclava or overalls were removed.
""In the case that medical imaging is required to inform diagnosis following an accident the presence of jewellery on the body can cause significant complication and delay,"" added the German.
Hamilton said he had tried without success to speak to FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem, who was elected in December, and wanted to assure the Emirati he was an ally rather than an opponent.
""I'll try and speak to him before the race,"" he said.",['119_0'],"[""\nFormula One F1 - Miami Grand Prix - Miami International Autodrome, Miami, Florida, U.S. - May 6, 2022  Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton before practice REUTERS/Ricardo Arduengo\n""]"

In a boost for the champions who have wrestled with a 'porpoising', or bouncing, car in the first four races, the Briton was 0.106 of a second faster than Ferrari's overall leader Charles Leclerc.
Russell's impressive time of one minute 29.938 seconds made Mercedes look more competitive than they have so far this campaign.  
""We always knew that the warm conditions here in Miami would suit our car better – we’ve suffered with getting temperature in the tyres at previous races so that’s a big factor here,"" said Russell.
""The car is running well but it’s only Friday, we’re not getting carried away. It’s probably been the most productive Friday we’ve had this season in terms of learning,"" he added.
Leclerc had been 0.071 quicker than the Briton in the opening session with a lap of 1:31.098.
Red Bull's world champion Max Verstappen, who was third in first practice, failed to set a time in the second session after his car suffered an hydraulics problem and the brakes overheated.
""He's had a horrible day,"" said team boss Christian Horner. ""It's frustrating not to have that track time.""
His Mexican team mate Sergio Perez was third fastest in practice two but was unimpressed with the Miami track.
""I am really disappointed there is no grip off-line. It’s a shame because I think the racing will be bad due to that. As soon as you try to go off-line, there is no grip,"" the Mexican said.
Leclerc and Verstappen have each won twice this season, with the Ferrari man 27 points clear of the Dutch 24-year-old whose efforts have been undermined by mechanical problems and retirements.
Mercedes have brought new parts in the hope of unlocking performance and first impressions were of clear improvement, with the car in a low-drag setup and looking faster without bouncing.
Russell's seven-times world champion team mate Lewis Hamilton was eighth and fourth fastest respectively in the two sessions.
""We still have the bouncing so we haven’t cured it but bit by bit, we’re improving the car,"" said Hamilton.
""The race is going to be tough, particularly with the tyres overheating and it’s very hot for the drivers, I’ve already lost a couple of kilos today,"" he said.
The humid first session around the Miami Dolphins' Hard Rock Stadium was halted with 24 minutes to go when Alfa Romeo's Valtteri Bottas spun backwards into the tyre barrier at turn seven, damaging his car's rear wing. 
Action resumed after a 10-minute break but Bottas did not go out in the second practice.
Haas driver Mick Schumacher and McLaren's Daniel Ricciardo were summoned to the stewards after an earlier incident that saw the German narrowly avoid smashing into the rear of the Australian's car. 
The stewards decided to take no further action.
Alpine's Esteban Ocon was reprimanded for a pit lane near-miss with Russell after the Frenchman's team made an unsafe release. 
Leclerc, bouncing back from a disappointing weekend at Ferrari's home Imola circuit two weeks ago, spun early on while team mate Carlos Sainz, sixth fastest, suffered a puncture after the red flag period.
The Spaniard then crashed in the second session.
Williams' Alex Albon, seventh fastest, was fined 800 euros  ($844) for speeding in the pit lane.
The second session was also briefly halted when Williams Nicholas Latifi stopped on track.

115,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/drivers-raise-concerns-over-bumpy-miami-track-2669666,Drivers raise concerns over 'bumpy' Miami track,"MIAMI: Lando Norris and Sergio Perez have criticised the track at the first Miami Grand Prix after several drivers struggled with the surface in the opening practice sessions.
McLaren's Norris took P6 after Friday's (May 6) second session but was far from happy with race conditions.
""It is extremely tricky. It is very bumpy in some areas which is not quite what we were expecting,"" Norris said.
""I think everyone was expecting it to be very smooth and beautiful but it's not,"" he added.
Alfa Romeo's Valtteri Bottas spun backwards into the tyre barrier at turn seven, damaging his car's rear wing in the first practice session while Ferrari's Carlo Sainz crashed into Turn 14.
""The surface is very tricky as well because you go off line anywhere and it is pretty much game over and you end up in the wall, so it punishing let's say,"" Norris said.
""That is why you have seen quite a few people ending up in the barriers. I feel like it isn't going to be great for racing now.
""That is the negatives but the positives are it is still a good track,"" he added.
Red Bull's Sergio Perez agreed with Norris's concerns.
""I am really disappointed there is no grip off-line. It’s a shame because I think the racing will be bad due to that. As soon as you try to go off-line, there is no grip,"" the Mexican said.
""It’s wet on that side. It feels very gravelly. Racing will be hard. I think it’s going to be an interesting race. We are all in the same boat. We don’t know exactly where we are,"" he added.
Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said drivers would have to find a way to handle the corners.
""There's only really one line. You go off line and there's zero grip. That's going to make racing a little bit tricky but they are finding their way into it and finding the balance and setup compromise for the types of corner that you've got here. It's quite challenging,"" he said.
George Russell of Mercedes was on top of the timesheets with the fastest lap in second practice, 0.106 of a second faster than Ferrari's overall leader Charles Leclerc.","['115_0', '115_1']","[""\n      Red Bull's Sergio Perez during practice.

A source told Reuters in March that Audi was ready to offer around €500 million (US$527.55 million) for McLaren as a means to enter.
Germany's Manager Magazin reported on Thursday that talks with McLaren were close to failing after months of negotiations.
Brown, chief executive of McLaren Racing, told reporters at the inaugural Miami Grand Prix that there was no question of any change of ownership.
""Our shareholders are very committed to McLaren. We did have conversations with Audi and we’re not for sale,"" said the American.
""Commercially we’re doing really well. Morale in the team is really good. We don’t have any interest in selling the racing team.
""We won’t consider a buy-out of McLaren,"" he added. ""It's up to (team principal) Andreas (Seidl) to decide what power unit he wants in the back of the racing car but any conversations around buying McLaren is a non-starter.""
Brown said McLaren were in a strong position financially.
""Our terms for any partnership would be we retain ownership of the racing team and if anyone wants to have a conversation that is different than that, then there’s no conversation to be had,"" he said.
""We're McLaren Formula One, that's what we're going to remain ... That's our starting point and the conversation wouldn't get any further than that.""
McLaren currently use Mercedes power units but Formula One is preparing new engine regulations from 2026.
Red Bull have been linked with Porsche in media speculation while Aston Martin and Williams, who both use Mercedes engines, have expressed an interest in linking up with Audi, who have also been talking to Alfa Romeo team operators Sauber.","['114_0', '114_1']","['\n      McLaren Chief Executive Officer Zak Brown.

Alpine said the chassis was cracked in the impact with the barrier and could not be changed in time.
""Esteban is physically fine and will race tomorrow,"" a spokeswoman said.
Perez's fastest lap of one minute 30.304 seconds around the Hard Rock Stadium was 0.194 quicker than Ferrari's world championship leader Charles Leclerc.
Red Bull's world champion Max Verstappen, 27 points behind Leclerc after four races, was third on the timesheets and 0.345 slower.
Alpine's Fernando Alonso was fourth and Aston Martin's Sebastian Vettel fifth.
Verstappen, who did only five flying laps on Friday and missed second practice due to an hydraulics issue, was back on the pace but had to brake hard late in the session to avoid crashing at the chicane.
The Haas pair of Mick Schumacher and Kevin Magnussen were sixth and eighth respectively with Alexander Albon ninth for Williams. 
Britain's George Russell, fastest for Mercedes in Friday's second practice, was only 17th while seven-times world champion team mate Lewis Hamilton was 15th as the team struggled again with a bouncing car.
Ocon smashed into the wall sideways at turn 14, the same point where Ferrari's Carlos Sainz had crashed on Friday, in an incident that brought out the red flags. 
The Frenchman was taken for medical checks due to the high G-forces and given the all-clear.

The pole was the Monegasque's third in five races this  season, and 12th of his career as well as the first time Ferrari had secured the top two grid positions since the 2019 Mexican Grand Prix.
Formula One world champion Max Verstappen qualified third for Red Bull, after looking like he would take the top slot with the fastest first flying lap. Mexican team mate Sergio Perez was fourth.
""The last weekend hasn't been great for me. I made a mistake in the race but today went well,"" said Leclerc, who finished only sixth after a late spin in Ferrari's home race at Imola in April.
""We are starting on pole and we need to finish the job tomorrow. They (Red Bull) are extremely quick in the straight lines, we are quick in the corners. It will be a tight challenge tomorrow,"" added the 24-year-old.
Sainz's front row slot, 0.190 of a second slower than Leclerc's time of one minute 28.796 seconds, marked a strong return after the Spaniard crashed in Friday practice.
""I haven't done any long runs yet... so tomorrow will be the first time to have a feel,"" said Sainz.
""It could be quite challenging but at the same time I am feeling confident with the car, the car is really good to drive around here so I think we can do a good job.""
Verstappen was 0.195 off the pole - and 0.005 off the front row - after having to slow on his final attempt when he pushed a bit too hard.
Any disappointment was tempered by the fact he did only a handful of timed laps on Friday before being sidelined by an hydraulics problem.
""Actually to be that competitive in qualifying, I was a bit surprised,"" said the Dutch driver, who is 27 points behind Leclerc in the championship.
""We have a good chance for tomorrow. We have good top speed. I think the car is handling quite well so I'm looking forward to that.""
But the Dutchman could not hide his frustration at his limited practice time.
""It's just been incredibly messy... we just make it super difficult for ourselves,"" he told reporters.
""Of course (I am) still pleased to be in third position and to actually be very close to the (Ferrari) guys but I think we can do so much better. Just actually operate a bit cleaner and smoother,"" he said.
Valtteri Bottas qualified fifth for Alfa Romeo with seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton sixth for Mercedes, who had George Russell back in 12th.
It was another disappointing session for struggling Mercedes who had shown some signs of progress in Friday's sessions.
""We were able to put it in a sweet spot and today in P3 we were completely off with the experiments we did,"" said team principal Toto Wolff.
""It creeped a little bit off but it was still bouncing like a kangaroo. The drivers are not happy with it and you can see that is the reason we are off,"" he added.
Hamilton said it was evident the team had a long way to go to get back to competing at the front of the grid.
“We’ll keep on chipping away, keep working at it. So much amazing work is going on in the background and everyone is working so hard. Unfortunately I don’t think we are necessarily moving forwards at the rate we would like to,"" he said.
“That gap is similar to the beginning of the year, I think. We have just got to keep our heads down, keep working, keep focused and keep trundling. Eventually we will get there,"" he said.
Pierre Gasly and Yuki Tsunoda start seventh and ninth respectively for AlphaTauri with Lando Norris sandwiched between them for McLaren. Canadian Lance Stroll qualified his Aston Martin 10th.
Alpine's Esteban Ocon did not take part in qualifying after crashing in final practice.

Hydraulic problems and an issue with a rear brake limited the Red Bull driver to a handful of laps in Friday's opening practice sessions, leaving him with little information on the track before Saturday's qualifying.
""It's just been incredibly messy... we just make it super difficult for ourselves, you know, basically know what, four or five laps yesterday,"" he told reporters after finishing behind the Ferrari pair of Charles Leclerc in pole and Carlos Sainz.
""You start today still learning the track, trying to find a setup because yesterday, you have no clue what worked or not really, not a lot of data to look at,"" added the Dutchman.
""Of course (I am) still pleased to be in third position and to actually be very close to the (Ferrari) guys but I think we can do so much better. Just actually operate a bit cleaner and smoother,"" he said.
Verstappen had looked like he would take the top slot with the fastest first flying lap, with Mexican team mate Sergio Perez fourth.
But in the end he was 0.195 off the pole - and 0.005 off the front row - after having to slow on his final attempt when he pushed a bit too hard.
Despite his annoyance at the lack of practice time, Verstappen said he was confident in the performance of the car.
""I think overall the car is competitive. We have good top speed again, I hope that is something which can help us tomorrow,"" he said.
Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said it would be key for his team to try to stop Ferrari from using Sainz to block Red Bull and let Leclerc pull away early in the race.
""For us its important to split them as quickly as we can. I'm sure there will be an element of team play there, to try and protect the lead car. Why wouldn't they? I think the start is going to be crucial, the first couple of laps will be crucial and then we'll get into it from there,"" he said.
But Horner suggested there could be plenty of surprises in what will be the first race on the Miami track with teams having to think on their feet.
""Ferrari are very, very strong around here. (It will take)  strategy, a bit of luck. (Let's) see what the weather does. There's a bit of rain around tomorrow as well so it could be a chaotic race. 
""The pitstop is going to be crucial because nobody has really done a long run so we don't know how the degradation is on these tyres. Is a two stop quicker than a one stop? It's going to be working it out on the fly.""
Horner suggested the race may come down to whether Red Bull can make the most of their pace on the straights or if Ferrari's advantage in the corners pays off.
""We've got a very different race car to Ferrari tomorrow, they are carrying a bit more downforce, they are quicker in some of the corners,"" he said. 
""We're definitely going to be a bit easier through the corners but we'll be much quicker on the straight tomorrow so it will be a fascinating contest.""

The track around the Hard Rock Stadium is making its race debut and both drivers had argued that an impact-absorbing Tecpro barrier should replace an unforgiving concrete wall at turn 14.
""I'm sorry to be critical but I told the FIA yesterday that my crash in second gear shouldn’t feel that hard, but today my neck was a bit in pain,"" Spaniard Sainz, who qualified on the front row, told Sky Sports television.
""I told them ‘Let’s put Tecpro there’ because it’s a very hard concrete wall.""
Sainz said he had brought the matter up in Friday's drivers' briefing but nothing had changed.
Ocon's crash cracked his car's chassis and meant he could not take part in qualifying, although he was cleared to race on Sunday.
""The impact has been so hard in comparison to what it should have been. We've discussed it with Carlos yesterday, with the race directors, to say that we should probably put a Tecpro barrier there and it hasn’t been listened,"" he added.
""That is not acceptable, and the FIA should push harder for our safety.""
A spokesman for the governing FIA said the drivers' concerns had been taken on board and officials inspected the area of impact but decided no changes were necessary from a safety perspective.
""There was damage to the cars but that's not why we put in Tecpro,"" he added.

The 23-year-old Williams F1 development driver is chasing her third title in the F1 support series and she led every lap on Sunday for her fourth win in a row after two in Austin, Texas, at the end of last season.
W Series aims to help women reach Formula One, which has not had a female race driver since Italian Lella Lombardi in 1976, but Chadwick is back after failing to secure a seat alongside the men in F2 or F3.
""I'm just happy to bounce back from yesterday because although we got the win I didn't know if I deserved it,"" said Chadwick, who races for the Jenner Racing team of Caitlyn Jenner and won from pole.
""First proper race under green flag conditions, I was really happy I could get that one under our belt,"" she added after winning by nearly three seconds.

Leclerc finished a fighting second, 3.786 seconds behind after starting on pole position, with Spanish team mate Carlos Sainz completing the podium at the Miami Dolphins' Hard Rock Stadium.
The victory was the Dutch driver's third of the season, and second in a row, and he made it happen with a crucial overtake around the outside on Sainz at the start to seize second place before blasting past Leclerc on the ninth of the 57 laps.
Verstappen, who also made sure of the bonus point for fastest lap, then held off a late attack from Leclerc after a safety car period triggered by McLaren's Lando Norris crashing on lap 41.
""It was an incredible Grand Prix,"" said Verstappen, who has won every race he has finished so far this season and was handed his winner's trophy by Dolphins NFL quarterback great Dan Marino.
""(It was) very physical but I think we kept it exciting until the end.""
Leclerc was right on Verstappen's tail with five laps remaining, with the safety car bunching up the pack, after struggling with the medium tyres on his opening stint.
""On the hard (tyres) we were very competitive and towards the end I thought I could get Max at one point but today they had the advantage in terms of pace,"" said the Monegasque.
Verstappen's Mexican team mate Sergio Perez finished fourth, with Ferrari retaining the lead in the constructors' standings on 157 points to Red Bull's 151.
Perez tried to pass Sainz on lap 52 but overcooked his move, with the Spaniard forcing his way back in front and staying there.
George Russell continued his record of finishing every race so far in the top five, with Mercedes team-mate and seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton sixth.
Valtteri Bottas was seventh for Alfa Romeo with Alpine's Esteban Ocon eighth in a stirring fight back after being unable to take part in Saturday's qualifying due to a practice crash that forced the team to change his car's chassis.

The Dutchman has won all three races that he has completed this season but failed to finish in Bahrain and Australia because of fuel-related problems.
Hydraulic problems and an issue with a rear brake limited Verstappen to a handful of laps in Friday's opening practice sessions in Miami, leaving him with little information on the track before Saturday's qualifying, where he grabbed third place on the grid.
In Sunday's race he was quickly able to get in front of Ferrari's Carlos Sainz, and then on the ninth lap overtook Charles Leclerc, who had started in pole, grabbing the lead.
""It’s a very good comeback. I didn’t even do a [practice] start, so I didn’t know what to expect in the actual start. But we had a good launch, and I saw the opportunity to go around the outside [of Sainz] in Turn 1 so I tried. Luckily it worked,"" he said.
Although the Dutchman was clearly delighted with the 23rd win of his career in F1, he was eager to remind his team that they needed to step up their game.
""I had a lot of issues on Friday, which compromises your weekend, and especially (qualification) yesterday. Today everything went well with the start, but it also could have been the other way around.
""So we just have to nail down a really positive weekend without issues,"" he said.
""At Imola we had that, but it's still a bit of a hit and miss too much too much. So we just have to make sure that we are more reliable and more on top of things. But as you can see the car is quick and I'm very happy about that. I mean, if we would be slow and reliable, that's probably also not a good thing,"" he said.
Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said Verstappen's teammate Sergio 'Checo' Perez's car had a problem that hampered his effort to reach the podium.
""We had a sensor issue on Checo’s engine, the guys did well to move them around but he lost probably 30 horsepower with that,"" he said.
""He was losing half a second a lap, without that he might even have been second. With the tyre advantage, because we’d pitted him, he had that grip advantage over the Ferraris.""
The Red Bull chief struck a confident tone for the future with his team just six points behind Ferrari in the constructors' championship and Verstappen 19 points behind Leclerc in the drivers' standings.
""The car’s running well. We’ve got some developments hopefully coming later in the summer that will help as well, we need to save a little bit of weight but generally we’re on a good trajectory,"" he said.",['106_0'],"[""\nRed Bull's Max Verstappen celebrates with the trophy on the podium after winning the Miami Grand Prix.

105,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/mercedes-left-no-illusions-after-latest-disappointment-2672341,Mercedes left with no illusions after latest disappointment,"MIAMI: A good Friday turned into a stinging Sunday (May 8) for Mercedes at the Miami Grand Prix with George Russell and Lewis Hamilton sweating to fifth and sixth-place finishes, and under no illusions about how far off the pace they remained.
After winning the last eight constructor's titles, Mercedes are well adrift in third place in the standings, already 62 points behind leaders Ferrari and 56 behind second-ranked Red Bull.
Mercedes had shown signs of better performance in Friday's practice sessions, but that proved to be a false dawn with neither of the cars ever in contention to win on the new South Florida track.
""At the end of the day there is no happy moment. We are third quickest on the road and in a way, in no man's land. We had a good Friday, we need to dissect why that was and then come back,"" said team principal Toto Wolff.
""This is where we are. We are probably not as quick in qualifying sometimes and we have the outliers. But we go back to where we are and that is behind the Red Bulls and Ferrari,"" he said.
Russell had started 12th on the grid after a disappointing Saturday and moved up well, eventually getting past his team-mate.
""I think it's mixed feelings because based on where we were yesterday today was a good result. But if you'd told me after Friday we'd finish P5 and P6 (fifth and sixth) and that far behind P1 (first), I'd have been pretty disappointed,"" said Russell.
""We have a fast race car in there, we just don't have the key to unlock performance and we don't really understand why that is. There's work to do,"" he said.
Russell said the bouncing problem that the cars have been suffering had been better than in Saturday's difficult qualifying.
""It wasn't much nicer today but because the speeds were lower the aero wasn't working as hard so I could sort of manage it. It's frustrating but I'm sure we'll get there at some point.
""There was one point when I thought 'here we go, we're getting a bit closer' but ultimately those guys are just quicker than us and we need to unlock the performance that we do have in the car,"" added the Briton.
Seven-time world champion Hamilton questioned his team asking him to make the decision on whether to return to the pits for softer tyres when the safety car was out.
""In that scenario I have no clue where everyone is and so when the team say it's your choice I don't have the information to make the decision,"" he said.
""So that's what your job is, make the decision for me. You've got all the details. That's what you rely on the guys for, today they gave it (the decision) to me and I didn't understand it,"" he added.
But Hamilton was trying to keep a brave face on the team's troubles.
""At least we got points, we're finishing, reliability is good. We just have to keep trying to ... I'm excited to at some stage take a step forward, which we haven't yet,"" he said.
Engineering Director Andrew Shovlin agreed that the team was making the most of a bad situation but said there was no escaping the cold reality.
""It was encouraging to see that pit stops and reliability were strong as good operations have helped us keep the points gap to the leaders to a minimum so far this season,"" he said.
""However, we're under no illusion that we must close that lap time gap down in the next few weeks if we are to present any kind of challenge to Red Bull or Ferrari.""",['105_0'],"[""\nMercedes' George Russell in the pits during the race. (Photo: Reuters/Brendan Smialowski)\n""]"

FERRARI (Charles Leclerc 2, Carlos Sainz 3)
Leclerc started on pole, with Sainz alongside in Ferrari's first front row lockout since Mexico 2019. Sainz was passed by Verstappen into the first corner and the Dutch driver then took  Leclerc on lap nine. A late safety car allowed Leclerc to close the gap but Verstappen held on to win and cut Leclerc's lead to 19 points from 27. Ferrari are six points clear in the constructors' standings.
RED BULL (Max Verstappen 1, Sergio Perez 4)
Verstappen took his third win of the season, second in a row and 23rd of his career after starting third on the grid. He led from lap nine, apart from when he pitted on lap 26, and took a bonus point for fastest lap. Perez suffered a sensor problem on lap 20 that cost him time and a possible podium finish.
MERCEDES (George Russell 5, Lewis Hamilton 6)
Russell started 12th, and dropped to 15th after a slow start, but did a long stint on the hard tyre before pitting for mediums on lap 41 when the virtual safety car was deployed. Hamilton started sixth on mediums and pitted on lap 23. The seven times world champion collided with Alonso on the opening lap, dropping to eighth. He was passed by Russell late on with his team mate benefiting from fresher tyres.   
MCLAREN (Daniel Ricciardo 13, Lando Norris retired)
Norris started eighth but crashed out after a collision with Pierre Gasly on lap 40 that triggered the safety car. Ricciardo started 14th and collected a five-second penalty for leaving the track and gaining an advantage.
ALFA ROMEO (Valtteri Bottas 7, Guanyu Zhou retired)
Zhou was the first retirement of the race, pulling into the pits on lap seven with a water leak. Bottas continued his strong form, running in fifth place until a late mistake under pressure while braking allowed the Mercedes pair to slip through.     
ALPINE (Esteban Ocon 8, Fernando Alonso 11)
An eventful race for the Alpine pair, with Ocon starting last after a crash in practice ruled him out of qualifying. Alonso gained four places at the start and crossed the line eighth but dropped to 11th due to a post-race five second penalty for causing a collision with Gasly. The Spaniard recognised he was at fault for the incident.
ALPHATAURI (Yuki Tsunoda 12, Pierre Gasly retired)
Gasly's car was damaged in a collision with Alonso and then terminally when he and Norris made contact as the AlphaTauri was heading back to the pits. Tsunoda lost places at the start and was unable to recover them.
HAAS (Mick Schumacher 15, Kevin Magnussen 16) 
Schumacher looked like ending the wait for his first points in Formula One but a late collision into turn one with Vettel dashed those hopes. Stewards declared a racing incident but Aston Martin blamed the younger German, who had to pit for a new front wing. Schumacher had passed Magnussen and was in ninth place. Magnussen collided with Stroll at turn two after the safety car restart, collecting a five second penalty, and stopped in the pits on the last lap.
ASTON MARTIN (Lance Stroll 10, Sebastian Vettel 17) 
Both Aston Martin drivers started from the pit lane due to a fuel temperature problem. The safety car played into their hands and both could have scored but contact with the Haas drivers ended Vettel's hopes. Stroll was promoted to 10th after Alonso's penalty, Vettel did not finish but was classified. 
WILLIAMS (Alex Albon 9, Nicholas Latifi 14) 
Albon scored for the second time this season, after starting 18th on the medium tyre and pitting on lap 16 for hards. He finished 10th but moved up after Alonso's penalty.

103,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/motor-racing-first-points-schumacher-vanish-after-vettel-crash-2672421,Motor Racing-First points for Schumacher vanish after Vettel crash,"MIAMI :     Mick Schumacher's chances of scoring his first points in Formula One evaporated in the Miami heat on Sunday after he collided with his mentor Sebastian Vettel with just four full laps of the Grand Prix remaining.
The 23-year-old German, who went through his debut season for Haas last year without picking up a point, was challenging Esteban Ocan for ninth spot on lap 53.
But the incident with Vettel left Schumacher needing to stop for a new wing and he ended up frustrated in 15th place.
The stewards ruled that neither driver was to blame for the collision and unsurprisingly, given their close relationship, there was no finger pointing from the drivers.
“Obviously a shame that we made contact and both of us out of the race, out of the points,"" said Vettel, who was put out of the race by the crash.
""I’m disappointed for Mick and myself obviously that the two of us lost a good opportunity to score points today.
“I don’t know, I did not expect him, I need to have a look again. When I saw him, it was obviously too late, so we made contact,"" said the Aston Martin driver.
Schumacher's father, seven-times world champion Michael, was Vettel's boyhood hero and took him under his wing early in his career.
Schumacher senior has not appeared in public since he suffered severe head injuries in a skiing accident in the French Alps in December 2013.
Vettel has taken on the role of offering advice and a helping hand to Mick Schumacher, who was not surprised there was no hostility in Vettel's reaction to the incident.
“No, the same from my side,"" he said, ""It’s nice that I can learn from him, he’s so valuable to me as a friend, so yeah, we’ll see. Obviously we’re all racers.
“Obviously, it’s hard to say and hard to judge from inside the car.
“So, I have to wait and see how it looks from the outside. But I’m sure it will also be good for me to see what Seb thinks about it. We’ll just have to move on from here.”
Schumacher still managed to take some encouragement from his performance where had looked well placed for a top 10 finish.
""I think the pace was there,"" he said. ""It all was looking good but unfortunately the last few laps were a bit chaotic.”

102,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/albon-dyeing-score-more-points-williams-2673616,Albon dyeing to score more points for Williams,"    Something was in the hair for Alexander Albon at the Miami Grand Prix as the Williams Formula One driver jokingly credited a splash of red dye for his second points scoring finish in three races.
The British-born Thai racer turned up at last month's Australian Grand Prix with a fresh look and bagged a point in 10th.
At the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola, with the hair colour fading, the 26-year-old finished 11th but with a fresh spread of red under his helmet for Miami he raced from 18th to ninth.
""No upgrades are ever needed, you just need to dye your hair. That’s all it is,"" he joshed with Sky Sports television.
The former Red Bull driver had explained the plan on Friday.
""We got it dyed before Melbourne and we finished 10th and then as the dye faded away, we finished 11th In Imola. So it started to affect the performance,"" he said. ""So, we re-dyed it, hoping for more points.""
The sweat of racing in the Miami heat also had some dramatic side effects.
""My balaclava is like soaking red, it’s bright red. All the dye has leaked. It looks like I’ve been beheaded,"" said Albon.
""We did say that if I scored points this weekend the whole team were going to dye their hair red. I just went to the engineering room and they’re all starting to backtrack their comments like ‘Ah no, it was a podium’.""
Joking apart, Albon said both he and Williams - still last in the constructors' standings and three points behind ninth-placed Aston Martin - were on the up.
""I just feel I’m doing a better job than I was a couple of years ago,"" said the Thai, who had a year out in 2021 after losing his seat at Red Bull to Mexican Sergio Perez but has come back strongly.
""I’ve had a year to address the places I want to work on and mature.
""We’re on the rise and myself as well. I feel like I’m improving every drive, I’m more experienced than I ever was and I’m feeling pretty good.""

101,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/andretti-bid-may-test-f1s-love-affair-america-2674216,Andretti bid may test F1's love affair with America,"MIAMI: Formula One just can't get enough of America and on Sunday the sport lapped up the celebrity-infused attention at the inaugural Miami Grand Prix, basking in finally having 'cracked' the US market.
When it comes to letting America's most famous racing family, Andretti, in on the action, however, the enthusiasm markedly wanes with the sport's cold commercial calculations coming to the fore.
With Las Vegas next year set to become the third US race, after Austin and Miami, and fan and sponsor interest at an all-time high thanks to Netflix's 'Drive to Survive' series, there was a heady air of celebration at the Miami Gardens track.
""Mega. I think it is a fantastic achievement by all involved,"" said Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff.
""Formula One is all around, the amount of guest requests we have is amazing. I think we've finally landed in North America.""
If the glamour created such a buzz, with stars such as Tom Brady, Michael Jordan, Venus and Serena Williams appearing in a heaving paddock, the prospect of racing down the Vegas strip should guarantee another year of hype for F1 in America.
""The demand from sponsors and fans has been off the charts, unlike anything I've seen since my time in Formula One,"" said McLaren's American boss Zak Brown.
No surprise then that Michael Andretti, whose father Mario was the 1978 F1 champion and won the Indianapolis 500, wants a piece of the action.
Former McLaren driver Michael and Mario were in Miami, lobbying those in the sport to allow their planned Andretti Global team onto the grid.
The plan is for the team to have American drivers and an American-built car, more American than F1's existing US presence.
Haas is owned by American Gene Haas and is headquartered in North Carolina. The outfit is the sister team of NASCAR's Stewart-Haas Racing but has no American racer and uses a car built in Italy by Dallara.
British-based Williams is owned by US-based private investment firm Dorilton Capital.
With none of the 10 franchises up for sale, Andretti has to persuade the sport to allow an 11th team.
The current Concorde agreement, agreed between Formula One's American owners Liberty Media and the teams and governing FIA, is in place until 2025 and covers the money side of the sport.
""It makes total logical sense to say that the 10 teams or 10 franchises have an intrinsic value and you dilute that by increasing the number,"" said Red Bull principal Christian Horner.
Wolff said Andretti would have to bring in additional value as well as paying a US$200 million entry fee.
""If one is able to demonstrate that, then we should all be sitting on the table, and cheer for such an entry. But that hasn't been demonstrated yet,"" he said.
""The value of Formula One is that it's a limited amount of franchises. And we don't want to dilute that value by just adding teams.""
Horner said Liberty Media could reduce their own share if they wanted more teams, but Brown had no doubts Andretti would bring extra value.
""The Andretti name has a huge history, in Formula One, in various forms of motor sport, and I think would add a lot of value,"" he said.
""A very credible racing team with a credible brand, with the right resources, I think is additive to the sport. And that appears to be what Michael has put together. So, on that basis, we are supportive.""
Whether Brown remains sole cheerleader for his old friend or whether F1's turn to America leads to flexibility over expansion remains to be seen.",[],[]

The coverage of the race, won by Red Bull's Dutch world champion Max Verstappen, peaked at an average 2.9 million, it added.
The Netflix behind the scenes docu-series 'Drive to Survive' has been credited with fuelling Formula One's rising popularity in the United States, a market the sport had previously struggled to crack.
ESPN said average viewing numbers over the first five races were up 53 per cent on that for the same period in 2021, which was the most viewed F1 championship yet on U.S. television.
The same-day delayed broadcast of the 2002 Monaco Grand Prix, which followed the Indianapolis 500, averaged 2.784 million viewers and is the most-viewed Formula One telecast in U.S. television history.
ESPN said the previous record audience for a live race telecast was the 1.744 million it registered for the 1995 Brazilian Grand Prix.

Suzuki said in a statement ahead of the French Grand Prix that the move was for financial reasons and it was also considering ending other racing activities.
""Unfortunately, the current economic situation and the need to concentrate its effort on the big changes that the automotive world is facing in these years, are forcing Suzuki to drastically decrease racing related costs,"" it said.
Suzuki added that it wanted ""to use all its economical and human resources in developing new technologies"".
Dorna said last week it had contacted Suzuki to remind the manufacturer it could not take a unilateral decision under the terms of the contract with MotoGP.
Suzuki Motor Corporation only last year renewed its involvement in the MotoGP championship in a deal running until the 2026 season.
The manufacturer has quit MotoGP before, leaving the premier class after the 2011 season due to economic recession and a stronger Japanese yen. It made a full return in 2015.
The factory team won both championships in 2020 when Spaniard Joan Mir won his maiden title in a season shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Mir said he was angry at the decision and his manager was talking to Honda among others.
""We were in talks with Suzuki before everything happened and now, for sure, my manager will have more work than he expected,"" he added.
""He is speaking with Honda, with different manufacturers to try to fit my future outside Suzuki.""
Team mate and compatriot Alex Rins, who had planned to continue with Suzuki, said the news would hit other team members hard.
""In the end, I can find something for the next year I think but for them (the mechanics) it’s more difficult. I feel very sorry, they are like a family for me,"" he added.
Suzuki also won multiple championships in the top category over the decades since the 1970s with Britain's Barry Sheene, Italians Marco Lucchinelli and Franco Uncini and Americans Kevin Schwantz and Kenny Roberts Jr.
Team leader Davide Brivio left before the start of the 2021 season to join the Alpine Formula One team as their racing director.
Suzuki project leader Shinichi Sahara said at the time that Brivio’s departure was ""shocking news"" and a major blow to the Japanese manufacturer.",['99_0'],"[""\nPramac Racing's Johann Zarco, Team Suzuki Ecstar's Joan Mir and Ducati Lenovo's Jack Miller in action during the MotoGP race.

The three-times Olympian, triple world champion in 2017,  hopes to return to the rink for the 2026 Games after missing Beijing but the new eSkootr series debuting in London on Saturday is home for now.
Christie, 31, has endured years of trauma and physical and emotional pain, including self-harming, chronicled in a powerful autobiography ""Resilience"" in which she also speaks of being raped as a 19-year-old.
""eSC (eSkootr) picked me up at the worst point. I broke my ankle and thought it wasn’t worth going to the Olympics...I wasn’t going to be good enough so I chose to stop,"" she told Reuters.
""And then it was hard for me. So eSC came along, it was like a breath of fresh air...it’s such a good thing to be a part of, it’s like a family, we’re all really close.
""We’re trying to change the world and show that racing doesn't need to be damaging to the environment. I think people will love it.""
Christie spoke after addressing children in a South London primary school playground along with former BMX rider Trey Whyte.
DIVERSE SPORTS
The series, drawing male and female athletes from backgrounds as diverse as cycling, hockey, snowboarding and motorbike racing, aims to promote micromobility and sustainability.
Former world heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua has a team, as does Formula One racer and Le Mans 24 Hours winner Nico Hulkenberg, although neither are racing the 100kph machines.
Christie was soon converted.
""I got so used to being in an Olympic sport...but it wasn’t a nice world. This is such a nice thing to be a part of and it’s going to be a massive future,"" she said.
If there was much left unsaid from the past, she now felt a sense of release.
""You learn who your real friends are and you also make new ones. And that’s what I’ve done,"" said Christie, who still works for Pizza Hut after starting as a delivery driver but is planning a move back to Scotland.    
She had considered a future in bobsleigh or skeleton, both Olympic sports, but was now focused on improving her riding skills. The skates, taken off in October, could be back on next year.
""I want to make a point and I’ve got unfinished business,"" she said of her Olympic dream.
""But it’s not something I can definitely guarantee because financially it’s proving quite difficult and I can’t do it in this country because I don’t really get along with the federation very well.
""It looks like it would have to be somewhere in Europe like Italy, France, maybe Germany. A lot of places have offered that I can train for free, which you can’t get in England.""
Christie said age was less of a factor, with Canada's Charles Hamelin winning team gold in Beijing at the age of 37.
Injury is more of a concern for a skater with a long history of accidents.
After debuting at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, Christie arrived at Sochi in 2014 as a medal favourite but was disqualified from all three of her races after collisions. 
Four years later in Pyeongchang she also crashed, injuring her right ankle, or was disqualified.
""I did slip at work and break my nose the other day, I’ve actually not hurt anything scootering so far,"" she smiled. ""I was just being clumsy. I’m a clumsy person, always have been. 
""So I got a broken nose which has been fixed up. And other than that, all good. No niggles, no injuries. Fit and ready to go.""

Speaking on BBC Question Time, a television panel show mixing politicians and celebrity guests, the German was asked whether his position on the environment made him a hypocrite considering he was part of a ""gas-guzzling"" sport.
""It does, it does, and you're right when you laugh,"" the 34-year-old father-of-three replied. ""There's questions I ask myself every day and I'm not a saint.
""Certain things are in my control and certain things are not. It's my passion to drive a car, I love it and every time I step in the car I love it.
""When I get out of the car, of course I'm thinking as well 'Is this something that we should do, travel the world, wasting resources?'""
The Aston Martin driver wore a T-shirt before last weekend's Miami Grand Prix with the slogan ""Miami 2060 - first grand prix underwater - Act Now or Swim Later"" to highlight the effects of climate change.
He has also been outspoken about the environment and renewable energy as well as addressing human rights and LGBTQ+ issues.
Vettel said Formula One, which is making a big push for sustainability, also played an important social role as entertainment.
""There's things that I do because I feel I can do them better. Do I need to take a plane every time? No, not when I can take the car,"" added the driver, who is out of contract with his team at the end of the year.
Formula One is aiming to achieve a net zero-carbon footprint by 2030, with 100 per cent sustainable fuels from 2026 when a new engine is introduced.
Vettel also offered opinions on Brexit, the war in Ukraine, whether Finland should join NATO, energy dependence and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's involvement in a ""partygate"" scandal over breaches of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions.",['97_0'],"['\nFILE PHOTO: May 6, 2022; Miami Gardens, Florida, USA; Aston Martin driver Sebastian Vettel of Germany talks with the media during a press conference before their practice session for the Miami Grand Prix at Miami International Autodrome.

""Following extensive discussions with the Chinese Football Association (CFA), the Asian Football Confederation has been officially informed by the CFA that it would not be able to host the AFC Asian Cup 2023,"" the confederation said in a statement.
""The AFC acknowledges the exceptional circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the relinquishment by China PR of its hosting rights.""
The AFC said a decision about the hosting of the tournament would be revealed in due course.
The Asian Cup is the latest international sporting event to be affected by China's attempts to tackle the pandemic.
Earlier this month, Asian Games organisers the Olympic Council of Asia postponed the next edition of the multi-sport event, due to be held in the Chinese city of Hangzhou in September, until 2023.
China continues to implement a zero-COVID policy and cities across the country have faced tight restrictions as a result of a recent outbreak of the Omicron variant.
Shanghai has been under lockdown for more than a month while other cities, including the capital Beijing, are facing a wave of additional curbs, frequent testing and targeted lockdowns.
Most international sporting events in China have been postponed or cancelled since the start of the pandemic, with the notable exception of the Winter Olympics, which went ahead in Beijing under strict health controls in February.
The Chinese Formula 1 Grand Prix has been not been held since 2019, while WTA events have been suspended due to a standoff over concerns relating to the safety of Chinese player Peng Shuai.
China is scheduled to host four ATP events this year, including the Shanghai Masters and the China Open in October.
The Chinese Super League is yet to announce when the new football season will begin.
The Chinese Football Association also gave up the right to host July's East Asian Championships, with that tournament now taking place in Japan.

Mercedes won both championships in the city-based series last year but had already announced their departure to focus on Formula One.
McLaren signed an option in January last year and had been assessing whether to add Formula E to a portfolio that includes Formula One, Indy Car, the electric off-road Extreme E championship and esports.
Season nine is the start of a new era for Formula E with its third-generation car billed as the world's most efficient and capable of reaching speeds of 320 kph (200 mph).
""Formula E has racing at the centre but will be strategically, commercially and technically additive to McLaren Racing overall,"" said McLaren Racing chief executive Zak Brown.
""It is also satisfying to provide a home for the class-leading Formula E team that Mercedes has built, which will become a fully-fledged part of the McLaren Racing family.""
Brown said the team would be run separately to the Formula One and IndyCar teams. 
Mercedes principal Ian James will continue in his role at a team founded in 2019 and McLaren's deal with Mercedes is expected to complete later this year.
""I firmly believe that Formula E will give McLaren Racing a competitive advantage through greater understanding of EV racing, while providing a point of difference to our fans, partners and people,"" said Brown.
McLaren Racing are part of the McLaren Group, which includes  the supercar manufacturer and is majority-owned by Bahrain's sovereign wealth fund Mumtalakat.
Nissan, Jaguar, Porsche, Mahindra, Stellantis-owned DS and Maserati and China's Nio are the manufacturers so far signed up for 2023, when a $13 million cost cap will be in place for the 12 teams.
""I wanted McLaren to be part of the ... championship since Season One and I'm delighted we finally made it happen,"" said Formula E founder Alejandro Agag.
""But it is so much more than just deciding to go racing. Being part of Formula E signals a strategic investment in the future of electric vehicle development.""

Khalil Beschir, a co-founder of the eSkootr championship, saw a role similar even to the one played by motorsport in the early days of the automobile.
""Yes, we are creating a new sport, we are creating an accessible sport,"" the Lebanese entrepreneur and former car racer told Reuters ahead of Saturday's race.
""At the same time we have a mission to help governments, cities, to develop safe riders and to work with cities on the right way of using these scooters.""
""It’s where cars used to be in 1910,"" he said of the arrival in numbers of electric scooters on city streets four or five years ago. 
""People complained about them, hated them when they came to the cities: 'they are not safe, they are everywhere',"" he said.   ""We use the racing to be a lab, of safety, of infrastructure, of technology. 
""This is the aim of eSC - to develop this, as motorsport and Formula One did with the car industry.""
Austrian former F1 racer and twice Le Mans 24 Hours winner Alex Wurz, who is also the chairman of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association (GPDA), is a co-founder along with Brazilian former Formula E champion Lucas Di Grassi.
Formula One veteran Nico Hulkenberg has a team and there are plenty of people in the background with links to motorsport's world body, the International Automobile Federation (FIA).
The series has, however, set up its own commission, headed by Wurz, with a stated aim ""to regulate and promote the safe and sustainable development of micromobility in sport and urban micromobility"".
""We think that we have a really strong product,"" Wurz, who first started working on the concept in 2018, told Reuters at a former newspaper printing site in London's Docklands that hosted the first race.
""We have a huge opportunity for grassroots sport to be definitely the cheapest motorsport entry you can find and then a career ladder through to world championship level.
""Beside our sporting ambition, from the first minute I said micromobility is such a hot, fast growing topic and sector we have an obligation to create a synergy between racing and road safety.""
SPEED RESTRICTIONS
Insurers see e-scooters as inherently more dangerous than bikes or cars while trial projects for e-scooter providers in some cities have featured speed restrictions and tight regulations.
In London, electric scooters are a common sight but currently legal only on private land or via authorised hire schemes, although the government has said it is planning new rules to expand usage.
Wurz said it was ""mind blowing"" how many interested cities and stakeholders had approached eSC, and he hoped to have an influence on urban design.
""The way we are consuming mobility is fundamentally changing,"" he added. 
""In the future some of our roads will actually become living space, a shared space where you walk, some on cycles, some on electric scooters and we need to co-exist.
""And we can. That’s the journey - to educate people, to regulate, to create the engineering. How we are separated but yet together. The legislation needs to be in line.""
The eSkootr machines raced by 30 riders from 10 teams weigh some 40kg and feature two six kw motors with top speeds in excess of 100kph.
The tyres are produced from vegetable oil and the grip allows the male and female riders - drawn from sports ranging from snowboarding and speed skating to hockey, cycling and motorbikes  - to lean 60 degrees into the corners.
The inaugural winner around the 12-turn 470 metre course was Swiss rider Matis Neyroud, ahead of Britain's Dan Brooks and India's Anish Shetty.       
Other races will follow in Switzerland, Italy, France, Spain and the United States with Asia and Africa likely to be added from next season.
A global broadcast agreement has been signed for races to be shown in more than 200 countries on sports streaming platform  DAZN.      
""I think it will catch on. Everyone I’ve told about it and who has seen about it, they think it’s so interesting and going to be fun,"" said Britain's former BMX world championship bronze medallist Tre Whyte. ""I just loved it straight away.""

90,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/f1s-jewellery-ban-right-reasons-says-gpdas-wurz-2688066,"F1's jewellery ban is for right reasons, says GPDA's Wurz","LONDON :     Formula One is right to ban jewellery from the cockpit but the governing FIA could have enforced the rule in a less confrontational way, according to Grand Prix Drivers' Association (GPDA) chairman Alex Wurz.
Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton and the FIA were in a standoff at this month's Miami Grand Prix over piercings the Mercedes driver has raced with for years and said he could not remove.
Hamilton has been told to take them out by the Monaco Grand Prix on May 29 but has said he has no intention of doing so.
""It is a rule for the right reasons,"" former Benetton, McLaren and Williams driver Wurz, who is heavily involved in driver safety and education, told Reuters.
""I would have probably liked a slightly different approach of how to deliver the message.
""I don't want to end up in football where there are more hands in the air and verbal abuse...you have to work together. It's a style I would have preferred in this case.""
The ban on jewellery, as well as the wearing of non-compliant under-garments, has long been in the rules but rarely enforced until the FIA clamped down this season.
It says items beneath the mandatory flameproof clothing could increase the risk of burn injuries and has highlighted the risk of critical delays or complications if medical imaging is required following an accident.
FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem told the Daily Mail last week he wanted Hamilton to send the right message to young drivers as a role model.
Wurz said he had never forgotten a talk he attended as a youngster given by Danish former racer Kris Nissen, who had a fiery sportscar crash at Japan's Fuji circuit in 1988.
""He showed his body and said 'look at this',"" recalled the 48-year-old.
""For him the absolute most painful thing after fire, and it wasn't a long fire, was the rubber (elastic) in his normal pants being burnt into the skin. He said (it was) for years agony and pain. And it educated me.
""At this moment I said I don't want to live these consequences, only for (not) taking my pants off and putting fireproof underpants on. The same with jewellery.""
MIAMI ADVICE
Wurz said the GPDA was talking to the FIA about the body's refusal in Miami to shield a concrete wall with an energy-absorbing Tecpro barrier after Alpine's Esteban Ocon and Ferrari's Carlos Sainz crashed heavily.
Several drivers accused the FIA of ignoring their concerns, although the body said it had listened to their advice but decided no changes were needed.
Wurz said hitting a concrete wall, even in a second gear corner, was going to hurt.
A Tecpro barrier could almost halve the G forces, he added, and mean a driver would not need medical checks and the chassis and gearbox would remain intact.
That would save money, with teams subject to budget caps, and remove the need to fly a damaged chassis back to Europe, adding to the carbon footprint.
Wurz said the GPDA had been told a barrier was available and could have been installed.
""Strictly speaking we didn't have an injury, so maybe you can say it (the barrier) is not necessary but we want to say that if we had it, it would improve the situation,"" he added.
""No research in the world can tell me it would have been a downside to put it (there).""

89,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/baku-keen-become-f1-sprint-race-next-season-2688141,Baku keen to become an F1 sprint race next season,"LONDON :     Azerbaijan wants its Formula One Grand Prix in Baku to be one of six proposed Sprint weekends next season, promoter Arif Rahimov said on Monday.
Speaking to reporters on a Zoom call, Rahimov said the subject was on his agenda for discussion with Formula One around this year's June 12 race.
""I quite like the sprint races, they add a lot more action,"" he said.
""The appeal with the sprint race, not just for Baku but for any promoter, is definitely that it looks like it will bring more fans on Saturday.
""We're a market where most of the fans are not as educated in the sport itself so when you say that we have two races...that will definitely increase the attendance on a Saturday and give them more value for money.""
Formula One has yet to confirm six sprints next year, despite the teams and commercial rights holder Liberty Media voting in favour, after the governing FIA called for further evaluation.
Three sprint weekends are scheduled for 2022, with the first held at Imola in Italy last month and the other two due in Austria and Brazil.
The format sees qualifying for the official pole position on Friday, with Saturday's race then setting the grid for Sunday's grand prix.
""I'd be glad to have the sprint race here in Baku next year,"" said Rahimov. ""I hope we are one of those six races that will get it.""
""I'm a big proponent of it. I really like the idea. I think it's good just to mix things around a little bit throughout the years. Things get boring and people just get too used to the same format and then they lose their interest.""
Last year's race in Baku was held without spectators due to the COVID-19 pandemic after being cancelled in 2020. This year will see a return to normal crowds.

2021 pole position: Lewis Hamilton (Britain) Mercedes
2021 race winner: Hamilton
Start time: 1300 GMT (1500 local)
SPAIN
The Circuit de Catalunya is celebrating its 32nd year as host of what will be the 52nd world championship Spanish GP.
Hamilton has won six times in Spain (2014, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021), a record he shares with Michael Schumacher, but a sixth in a row for the seven times world champion looks unlikely.
Other past winners are Sebastian Vettel (2011), Fernando Alonso (2006, 2013) and Max Verstappen (2016).
Verstappen is one of four drivers to have taken his first F1 win in Spain.
The winner at the Circuit de Catalunya has started on pole 23 times in 31 races. 
The only drivers to win in Barcelona and not start on the front row were Schumacher (third on the grid in 1996), Alonso (from fifth in 2013) and Verstappen (fourth in 2016).
Alonso and Ferrari's Carlos Sainz are Spain's current drivers.
Ferrari are the most successful team at the Circuit de Catalunya with eight wins. Since 1951, the Italian team have won  12 times in Spain.
RACE WINS
Hamilton has a record 103 wins from 293 starts. He has yet to win this year, however, and his most recent was in Saudi Arabia last December.
Verstappen has won 23 races, Leclerc four. 
Ferrari have won 240 races since 1950, McLaren 183, Mercedes 124, Williams 115 and Red Bull 78.
Verstappen has won three of five races this season, Leclerc the other two.
POLE POSITION
Hamilton has a record 103 career poles, most recently qualifying fastest in Saudi Arabia last year.
Leclerc has been on pole three times this year, with Red Bull's Sergio Perez and Verstappen taking the other two.
Hamilton has been on pole six times in Spain, with Schumacher holding the record of seven.
FASTEST LAP
Leclerc took the fastest lap bonus point in the first three races, Verstappen in the latest two (Imola and Miami).
POINTS
Leclerc is 19 points clear in the championship.
Ferrari lead Red Bull by six points in the constructors' standings.
Leclerc and Mercedes' George Russell are the only drivers to have scored points in every race so far this year. Russell is the only one to have finished all in the top five.

87,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/sainz-has-his-moment-shine-spain-2694066,Sainz has his moment to shine in Spain,"BARCELONA: Carlos Sainz has yet to step up as a Formula One winner but Sunday's (May 22) Spanish Grand Prix is a chance for the Ferrari driver to end his 146-race wait in front of a home crowd and as the season enters a new phase.
Sainz has a winning car, with team mate Charles Leclerc taking two of five races so far and leading the championship, and will have a full house cheering him on after two pandemic-hit years.
The 27-year-old has always scored at the Circuit de Catalunya, where overtaking can be a challenge, and the last time Ferrari won there it was with a Spanish driver - Fernando Alonso in 2013.
Two times world champion Alonso, now with Renault-owned Alpine, remains the only Spanish F1 driver to have won at home.
""The goal, as in every other race weekend, is to extract the maximum out of our car and try to win the Grand Prix,"" said Sainz, who has been on the podium three times this year including second in the Bahrain opener.
""I know we will receive massive support from every grandstand at the track and I can guarantee the fans maximum effort from myself and from the entire team, to give them plenty to cheer about.""
Leclerc is 51 points ahead of Sainz but only 19 clear of Red Bull's Max Verstappen, a situation that leaves open the question of 'team orders' being imposed although the season is still young.
Leclerc and Verstappen have won every race, with the tally 3-2 in the Dutch driver's favour, and the two will likely be going wheel to wheel again.
The race marks the real start of the European season, despite a race at Italy's Imola circuit last month, and is the point at which teams pump up development.
Ferrari team boss Mattia Binotto has spoken already of ""important' upgrades to close a performance gap Red Bull have opened.
Verstappen is chasing a third successive win, after Imola and Miami, for only the second time in his career and at the circuit where he became Formula One's youngest winner in 2016 as an 18-year-old.
""Hopefully we can keep the momentum going from the last few races with a clean start from Friday onwards,"" said the Red Bull driver.
Champions Mercedes are also hopeful of progress after a tough start to the campaign.
""A huge amount of hard work has been going on in the factories to unpick the data from Miami and turn it into improvements for Barcelona,"" said team boss Toto Wolff.
""Having run there in winter testing, albeit with a car that has evolved a lot since then, it will be a good place to correlate the information we have on the current car and we're hopeful that we'll make another step forward.""

The Spaniard said he was feeling the pain of having to race with a stiffer suspension to counter the bouncing, or 'porpoising', that some teams are experiencing due to aerodynamic rules introduced this season.
Asked at the Spanish Grand Prix how the cars might handle around Monaco next week, Sainz called for a broader debate.
""More than Monaco ... it's how much of a toll a driver should be paying for his back and his health in a Formula One career with this kind of car philosophy?,"" he told reporters. ""I think we need to open the debate more than anything.
""I think the regulations are great. They're doing exactly what we needed for racing. But do we need to run as stiff for our necks and back as we are having to run lately?
Sainz, who came into Formula One in 2015 and has started 145 races, said he felt the change.
""I've done my usual checks on my back, neck tightness etc and I see this year I'm tighter everywhere.
""I'm already feeling it. I don't need expert advice to know that 10 years like this it's going to be tough, and you're going to need to work a lot in mobility, flexibility.""
Lando Norris, Sainz's former team mate at McLaren, was less sympathetic.
""I would have thought you'd have much worse effects from crashing a car at 50 or 60G like some of us have done, "" said the Briton, whose car bounces less than others.
""There's also many ways for them to stop porpoising. Like lifting your rear ride height 20mm,"" added Norris, knowing that would also negatively affect speed and performance.",['86_0'],"[""\nFerrari's Carlos Sainz Jr. ahead of the Spanish Grand Prix. (Photo: REUTERS/Nacho Doce)\n""]"

The twice world champion was ruled on Friday to have impeded Mercedes' seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton in the day's first session at the Circuit de Catalunya.
It was his first reprimand of the season.
The Alpine driver had earlier blasted stewards for handing him two five-second penalties at the previous race in Miami, the last dropping him from eighth at the finish to 11th.
""We believed that it was very unfair and it was just incompetence from the stewards,"" the 40-year-old told reporters.     ""They were not very professional.""
The governing FIA, whose international sporting code lists a range of penalties from a warning to exclusion, said it would respond.
Alonso was later seen in conversation with FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem in the paddock.
The Spaniard had accused the four Miami stewards, who included 1985 Indianapolis 500 winner and 1988 CART champion Danny Sullivan, of making their minds up without hearing evidence in his defence.
""We arrived after the race with proof that we had given the time back that we gained and they (the stewards) were just packing up. They were not even in the room,"" he said.
""We showed them all the data, so they said give us five minutes and then they found themselves with their hands tied probably because they had issued already the penalty.
""It's already the past but it is something that should not happen in Formula One with the professionalism and standard that Formula One has.""
Alonso also suggested race director Niels Wittich, who is sharing the role with Eduardo Freitas following the removal of Michael Masi after a controversial 2021 season-ender in Abu Dhabi, lacked the necessary knowledge of racing.
The Spaniard said there was still plenty of room for  improvement.
Freitas is in charge this weekend after Wittich handled the opening five races.
""Freitas has a lot more experience with WEC (world endurance) and other categories at the top level and I think that will already improve things,"" said Alonso.

Red Bull principal Christian Horner had expressed concern that his team's intellectual property had found its way to their rivals, in a breach of rules banning so-called 'reverse engineering'.
The governing FIA said it had carried out a ""routine pre-event legality"" check of Aston Martin's planned aerodynamic upgrade.
It said it became apparent during the process that ""a number of features' on the car resembled those on a competitor's and an investigation was carried out to check compliance with the rules.
""The investigation...confirmed that no wrongdoing had been committed and therefore the FIA considers that the Aston Martin aerodynamic upgrades are compliant,"" it added.
The FIA said the rules allowed designs to be influenced by others, as has always been the case.
Red Bull, who are fighting Ferrari for both championships while Mercedes-powered Aston Martin are ninth of the 10 teams after a difficult start to the season, noted the FIA's ruling ""with interest"".
Aston Martin, owned by Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll, have big ambitions and have recruited some high-profile names  from other teams including Red Bull.
They include technical director Dan Fallows, Red Bull's former head of aerodynamics who started at the Silverstone factory last month.
""Copying is the biggest form of flattery,"" Horner told the BBC before the FIA statement.
""It is quite a thing to instruct your team to come up with a very close-looking clone of our car and of course a few people have moved over the winter period, and what you can't control is what they take in their heads.
""What would be of grave concern to us would be if any IP had in any way changed hands. That is where we rely on the FIA to do their job...""

Red Bull's reigning champion Max Verstappen was third fastest, 0.336 off the pace.
Leclerc has a 19 point lead over Verstappen after five races while Ferrari are six clear at the top of the constructors' standings.
Verstappen has won the last two races, however, whittling down the Monegasque's lead with a car that has been getting quicker as Red Bull introduce their own improvements.

Seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton and team mate George Russell said on Friday they expected the Circuit de Catalunya to determine the direction the team followed on development.
The early signs were promising as the team tested performance upgrades, with Russell second fastest and Hamilton third in practice.
""I'm positive, yeah. Super happy with the progress, so a big, big, big, big thank you to everyone back at the factory for not giving up and for continuing to push,"" Hamilton told reporters.
""We're not the quickest yet, but I think we're on our way. It's the first time we've driven down the straight without bouncing. We still have some bouncing, but it's way better.""
Team boss Toto Wolff said this month that he expected an answer after Barcelona to whether Mercedes had got their design philosophy right or wrong after eight years of domination.
Hamilton added: ""We will understand from this weekend whether where we are is the right direction and, if not, we'll ... move in another direction.
""I think it won't mean that we have to start from scratch, it will just probably be a side step in another direction,"" said the Briton.
Russell, who arrived from Williams at the end of last season to replace Valtteri Bottas, said it had taken time to identify the problem and come up with possible solutions.
""Miami was a first taste of the direction we need to take and this weekend will be the second taste,"" he said.
""I think we'll have a good conclusion after this weekend, if we can continue down the path that we've chosen, or we need to go down a different path.
""If this is the path, we're not going to suddenly see us on the top step of the podium,"" he added. ""Either way, we will have a positive outcome from this weekend.""

Formula One's modern drivers have accelerated away from the stereotype speed merchant and are finding strength in discussing subjects the high-octane sport has previously often found uncomfortable.
""I think we see really a decisive shift,"" Alex Wurz, the chairman of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association (GPDA), told Reuters after Vettel recently appeared on a British television panel show with politicians.
""Four or five years ago no-one wanted to engage in a conversation about any of the topics of racism, sustainability, human rights and such key topics. 
""Sport is now political, it’s not neutral. It’s impossible to be neutral,"" added the Austrian, a former driver for Benetton, McLaren and Williams. 
""And they (the drivers) have learned in a very short period of time to actually take the responsibility and represent values we all want to see.""
Vettel, a four times world champion, discussed subjects ranging from the war in Ukraine to Brexit and energy dependence when he appeared on ""Question Time"".
The Aston Martin driver said climate change had made him question his job travelling the world to race cars.
On Friday at the Spanish Grand Prix he explained his thinking.
""I often get the question 'Why is this important to you?',"" he said. ""This is not important to me, this is important to all of us.
""How can you ignore?... You don't have that luxury any more, to not care. Because, you know, it's the foundation of all of what we do.
""I think it's for all of us to think of what we can do to shift change to raise awareness.""
Wurz said he had noticed the difference in GPDA meetings, of which Vettel is a director along with Mercedes youngster George Russell.
""Sometimes we just give them the forum to talk and you think 'Wow, we have people here who make their living by being hard on track but they talk now about human aspects, about how to become better humans and how to lead by example',"" he said.
""I think the last four or five years have changed totally and it's really key for the sport. Key for the sustainability of the sport.""
Wurz said Hamilton, as a seven times world champion and the sport's only Black driver, had been a ""fantastic accelerator"" of change.
The Mercedes driver, with more than 28 million Instagram followers, has used his platform to promote fashion and shine a light on LGBTQ+ issues and rights abuses in countries the sport visits.
Hamilton and other drivers took the knee before races in 2020 and 2021 as part of the sport's ""We Race as One"" anti-racism initiative, although that ""grid moment"" has now been dropped.
Norris, 22 and with 5.3 million Instagram followers, has been open about his mental health battles and the pressure he experienced as a rookie.
""I do think it's a good thing,"" said the Briton of the environment.
""I've changed 100 per cent. I feel like a much more complete person, I understand things much better about the sport and about myself, so I can also voice my opinion more.
""The fact I can literally speak some honest words and it can affect hundreds of thousands of people and make them feel happier...that's what I find quite amazing.""

The Monegasque, who has a 19-point lead over Red Bull's reigning champion Max Verstappen after five races, was fastest in both Friday sessions and the man to beat again on a sunny Saturday.
He lapped the Circuit de Catalunya with a best time of one minute 19.772 seconds on the soft tyres, 0.072 quicker than Verstappen with Mercedes' George Russell third and 0.148 off the pace.
Verstappen complained over the radio that his car was not turning properly into turn five.
Seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton was fourth on the timesheets, 0.230 slower than Leclerc, with upgrades making the Mercedes look more competitive and with less bouncing on the straights.
Spaniard Carlos Sainz was fifth for Ferrari, with the team changing his chassis overnight due to a leaking fuel system, and Mexican Sergio Perez sixth for Red Bull.
Mick Schumacher suffered a right rear brake fire in the pits, with marshals and Haas mechanics hurrying to extinguish the flames. 
AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly failed to set a time with the Frenchman stopping early on with a smoking engine.

Main rival and reigning world champion Max Verstappen, who had looked like taking the top slot for Red Bull, had to settle for second after a late loss of speed wrecked his final effort at the Circuit de Catalunya.
Leclerc's lap of one minute 18.750 seconds was just over three tenths of a second quicker than Verstappen's best with the top two continuing a battle that has been the talk of the season.
""I had (some) moments on my lap but at the end I made it stick and I'm very, very happy with pole position,"" said Leclerc.
Ferrari's home hero Carlos Sainz secured third place, but 0.416 slower than Leclerc, with George Russell taking the fourth slot for a revived Mercedes team enjoying their best Saturday of the campaign so far.
Russell's team mate and seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton qualified sixth, behind Red Bull's Sergio Perez. The Briton has won the last five Spanish Grands Prix and six in total but that run now looks likely to end.
The pole was Leclerc's fourth in six races and second in succession.
Verstappen, who has won the last two races to close the championship gap to 19 points, complained over the radio of a problem at the key moment.
""I couldn't do my final run. I had a DRS (drag reduction system that) didn't open or I just lost power, so it's a bit of a shame,"" said the Dutch driver, who took his first win in Formula One at the circuit in 2016.
""To be on the front row for us here, looking at the whole weekend so far, it was a good achievement. But, of course, I would have liked to go for that final run.""
DRS ISSUE
Team boss Christian Horner later confirmed a DRS issue and said the engine was fine.
Sainz, who has yet to win in Formula One but will be cheered on by a capacity crowd after two years of pandemic-related restrictions, said everything was still possible.
""Conditions haven't been the easiest with the heat, with the wind, but today we managed to put in a decent lap which means we can fight tomorrow,"" he said.
McLaren's Lando Norris had looked set to make the top 10 but had his best lap time deleted in the second session for exceeding track limits, allowing Haas's Mick Schumacher to leapfrog ahead and qualify 10th.
Schumacher's team mate Kevin Magnussen will start eighth, with McLaren's Australian Daniel Ricciardo ninth.
Both Aston Martins went out at the first hurdle despite an eye-catching update package that drew accusations of copying from Red Bull.
Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel starts 16th and Canadian team mate Lance Stroll, son of the team's billionaire owner Lawrence, qualified 18th.
Twice world champion Fernando Alonso, the only Spaniard to win his home race, will start a disappointing 17th for Renault-owned Alpine.
The winner at the Circuit de Catalunya has come from pole position 23 times in 31 races.

The sport's most successful driver of all time, a seven times champion with 103 career wins, qualified sixth with Russell fourth.
That was the team's best qualifying performance in six races this season but Hamilton's former team mate Valtteri Bottas, seventh for Alfa Romeo, was closer to the 37-year-old on the timesheets than the Briton was to Russell.
The pair are 3-3 in qualifying after Saturday's session but Hamilton has been beaten by Russell, who joined from Williams at the end of last season, four times in five races.
Russell is 23 points clear of Hamilton.
""I'm still way off. My team mate's fourth. So that means the car should be at least third or fourth and I'm in sixth,"" Hamilton told reporters.
""I'm still struggling with the car. I don't know how to get around that, I don't know what I'm going to do but I will just continue to try and work hard and figure it out.""
Team boss Toto Wolff said Mercedes had taken a ""solid step"", in the battle to tame a bouncing car and would now be able to unlock more performance, and Hamilton welcomed that.
""We don't have the bouncing in a straight line which is a huge, huge difference,"" said the driver.
""But we still have the bouncing in turn three and nine so we've still got some improvements to make but the car's a lot, lot better.
""Now I'm just waiting for the engineers and the aerodynamicists to come through with some more bits for us to progress.""
Russell said the car would be better in the race than qualifying.
""I think we know the direction we need to go,"" he said. ""And we can focus on making the car quicker rather than problem solving.""

In an instant the Monegasque saw his Formula One championship lead disappear with Red Bull title rival Max Verstappen taking the win and vaulting to the top of the standings.
""No, no, no! Lost power,"" the Ferrari driver, who had started the day 19 points clear and ended it six behind, shouted over the radio on the 27th of the 66 scheduled laps at the Circuit de Catalunya.
There was nothing Ferrari, who also lost their lead in the constructors' standings to Red Bull, could do about it.
""It was a sudden issue,"" team principal Mattia Binotto told reporters.
""I think we learned it first from Charles going into the radio and then from the engineers looking at the data, it was sudden.
""We do not yet have an explanation, it will travel to Maranello during the night and we will disassemble it in the morning.""
The timing could not have been much worse, with Leclerc's home race in Monte Carlo and a showcase of the calendar coming next weekend.
Leclerc was on pole position at that race last year but failed to start due to a driveshaft problem, with Verstappen also going on to win.
Ferrari had arrived in Spain with high hopes that an upgrade package would allow them to claw back a performance advantage that Red Bull and Verstappen had stretched.
""The F1-75 was the quickest car on track yesterday and today, Charles was comfortably in the lead, running at a very good race pace,"" said Binotto.
There is an old saying in motor racing, however, that to finish first, first you have to finish and reliability has been a thorn in the side of both Red Bull and Ferrari this season.
Sunday's retirement was Leclerc's first in six races but Verstappen has already had two failures.
The Dutch driver has, however, won all four of the races he has finished.
""I feel like there is nothing more I can do apart from looking at the positives and there are plenty this weekend,"" said Leclerc.
""We cannot afford for this to happen many times in the season so we need to find the problem.""

Mexican Sergio Perez finished a dutiful second, 13 seconds behind but with the consolation of a bonus point for fastest lap, after being told to let his team mate pass for a third victory in a row after Imola and Miami.
The 24-year-old Dutch driver is now six points clear of Leclerc after winning four of six races - all those he has finished.
""A difficult beginning, but a good end,"" was how Verstappen summed up a baking afternoon in which he was blown into the gravel by a sudden gust of wind and wrestled with a malfunctioning rear wing.
Britain's George Russell came third for a revived Mercedes and after going wheel-to-wheel with Verstappen early on in a thrilling display of defensive driving as they battled for second place behind Leclerc.
Ferrari's Carlos Sainz was fourth, after fighting back from a slow start and a spin into the gravel, but it was scant reward for a team who had brought upgrades to try and turn the tables on Red Bull.
Leclerc was leading comfortably from pole position but a sudden loss of power before the halfway mark led to his retirement in the pits.
""No, no, no! Lost power,"" the Ferrari driver shouted over the radio as a seemingly sure victory was plucked from his hands by the engine failure.
The Monegasque waved to the capacity Circuit de Catalunya crowd but from then on could only watch his 19-point advantage evaporate.
""I had no indications before then. It just broke and lost the power completely,"" he told Sky Sports television.
Verstappen also suffered intermittent problems with his car's drag reduction system (DRS), leading to plenty of cursing over the radio, and he went off at turn four on lap eight.
""I went off when I had a lot of tailwind and lost the rear. My DRS was not always working. That made it very tough but we managed use strategy to get ahead,"" he said.
""I tried to stay focused. It is not nice when stuff like that happens. I am very happy to win and happy for Checo (Perez). It is a great result for the team.""
Seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton was fifth for Mercedes with a fine recovery drive after an opening lap collision with Kevin Magnussen's Haas dropped him to 19th.
He was passed by Sainz on the closing laps after Mercedes warned of a potentially terminal cooling issue.
""A race like that is like a win. It actually feels better than a win when you’ve come from so far back and through so much adversity,"" said Hamilton.
Alfa Romeo's Valtteri Bottas was sixth, ahead of Alpine's Esteban Ocon and McLaren's Lando Norris in eighth.
Norris revealed afterwards that he had been suffering tonsillitis and said it was that ""one of the hardest races I’ve ever done.""
Spain's twice world champion Fernando Alonso finished ninth in front of his home fans, after starting at the back of the grid, and AlphaTauri's Yuki Tsunoda collected the final point.","['75_0', '75_1', '75_2', '75_3']","[""\n      Formula One F1 - Spanish Grand Prix - Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain - May 22, 2022 Red Bull's Max Verstappen crosses the line to win the race Pool via REUTERS/Manu Fernandez\n    "", ""\n      Formula One F1 - Spanish Grand Prix - Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain - May 22, 2022 Red Bull's Max Verstappen celebrates with Helmut Marko after winning the race REUTERS/Nacho Doce\n    "", ""\n      Formula One F1 - Spanish Grand Prix - Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain - May 22, 2022 Mercedes' George Russell celebrates after finishing third REUTERS/Nacho Doce\n    "", ""\n      Formula One F1 - Spanish Grand Prix - Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain - May 22, 2022 Ferrari's Charles Leclerc after retiring from the race REUTERS/Albert Gea\n    ""]"

The seven-times world champion, whose Mercedes team mate George Russell finished third, said it all brought back memories of old and he felt a return to the top of the podium could be a possibility.
""A race like that is like a win. It actually feels better than a win when you’ve come from so far back and through so much adversity,"" he said.
Mercedes, winners of the last eight constructors' titles, have struggled with a bouncing car but performance upgrades have now put a spring in the step of their drivers.
Hamilton had said last month that ""we're obviously not fighting for this championship"" but he sounded more upbeat on Sunday.
Asked whether he felt he could win again this season, adding to his record tally of 103, the sport's most successful driver replied: ""Yes, definitely.
""We have made a lot of improvements in the car and the race pace is much better. The car is much nicer in the race. We have some improvements to make in qualifying,"" added the 37-year-old.
The Briton is 64 points adrift of Red Bull's world champion Max Verstappen, the winner on Sunday in a one-two with team mate Sergio Perez, but there are still 16 races to go.
Mercedes can now focus more on pushing performance than fixing problems.
""They experimented with something on George’s car that ultimately ended up being the better way to go in qualifying. Maybe in the next race I’ll take that,"" said Hamilton.
Hamilton and Haas driver Kevin Magnussen collided on the opening lap, dropping to the back, and the Briton felt he could otherwise have been fighting the Red Bulls.
""That gives me great hope that at some stage we will be fighting for a win,"" said Hamilton.
""I started the race today positive and then had that problem. But to then come back it felt like some of the older races I have done.

Television images immediately before the start, with ambient temperatures in the high-30s, had also showed the Briton looking unwell.

The Alpine driver last week blasted Miami Grand Prix stewards for handing him two five-second penalties, the last dropping the Spaniard from eighth at the chequered flag to 11th.
""We believed that it was very unfair and it was just incompetence from the stewards,"" the 40-year-old told reporters ahead of his home race at the Circuit de Catalunya. ""They were not very professional.""
Alonso spoke to new FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem after that outburst and on Sunday, after lining up last on the grid due to an engine change and finishing ninth in the race, took a  conciliatory stance.
""In reflection on Miami and Thursday, maybe I see it in a different way now,"" he said in a team review.
""The stewards did their job in Miami and perhaps we see things differently from inside the car in the heat of the moment.
""I am fully supportive of the FIA’s ideas and we want to work with them to improve the show for the fans.""
There was no immediate comment from the FIA.
Alonso was happy with the weekend, watched by a capacity crowd at the Barcelona circuit in a reminder of what it used to be like when the Spaniard was winning races with Renault, McLaren and Ferrari.
Many might have been for others, with world champion Max Verstappen's Dutch fans attending in droves and Ferrari's Carlos Sainz raising hopes of a home winner, while also indicative of the sport's surging global popularity.  
""Even though we were starting last I feel like we managed to put a show on for the fans,"" said Alonso.
""It feels a bit like a victory. Hopefully, we can start scoring consecutively in the points from here.""

Red Bull's Christian Horner warned at the Spanish Grand Prix that a majority of the 10 teams would struggle to comply with  financial restrictions imposed this season and an increase was needed.
Szafnauer said Renault-owned Alpine's predicted spending remained inside the annual cap and saw no reason to go beyond the current $140 million.
""We've set our budgets early, we kind of anticipated a little bit of the inflation. Inflation didn't just creep up on us,"" said the American, whose team are in sixth place after six races. ""If we can do it, for sure others can do it too. I'm not for just increasing the cap.""
Szafnauer said teams put a significant amount into the development budget, particularly in a year like 2022 with new regulations.
""When freight costs go up by 2.5 million or 3.5 million but your development budget is 20, can you not make your development budget 17 and still be under the cap? You can,"" he said.
""What that then does is it limits your development. So it's a lot easier, if you have the money, to go to the FIA and lobby to raise the cap and keep your development budget the same.""
Red Bull lead both championships after winning Sunday's race with world champion Max Verstappen leading team mate Sergio Perez, but the battle with rivals Ferrari and Mercedes is intense.
""We need the FIA to address the inflationary issue because I think basically probably about seven teams will need to miss the last four races to come within the cap this year,"" said Horner.
""It's not just about the big teams now, it's teams in the middle of the field that are really struggling with the inflationary rate that we're seeing.""
Horner said freight costs had quadrupled and the FIA had a ""duty of care"".
Szafnauer laughed at the idea of teams missing races to avoid breaching the financial rules. 
""It will move us up in the championship. I welcome that,"" he said. ""Should we plan for that or was he just being facetious?""

The fact that Red Bull's reigning champion has won every race he has finished also emphasises the importance of reliability in a season of major rule changes and rapid development.
Leclerc took 71 of 78 available points in the first three races. He has scored 33 since then.
Verstappen had 25 after round three in Australia and is now on 110, his tally boosted by an Imola sprint race that handed him eight extra points.
Champions Mercedes were down, and about to be counted out as they wrestled with a bouncing car, and yet Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix suggested George Russell and seven times champion Lewis Hamilton were back.
Hamilton went from 19th to fourth, eventually ceding a place as Mercedes told him his car was on the edge of a terminal over-heating problem, while Russell completed the podium in third place behind Verstappen and Red Bull's Sergio Perez.
Huge gaps, in points and performance, have come and gone remarkably quickly for a sport where the tiniest of fractions can be critical.
""Can we fight for another world championship? Well, we bet we can,"" said Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff, only weeks after saying virtually the opposite.
""We just need to have a car that is able to finish first and second. We have reasons to believe that we can get there,"" added the Austrian, hailing a big step for the team after recent tribulations.
""If you look at the odds they are against that but motor racing is a different ball game. We've seen today that Ferrari didn't score a lot of points although they should, so we are absolutely pushing flat out in order to bring us back into the game.""
Red Bull boss Christian Horner, who takes nothing for granted other than the sport's ability to surprise, has always said he expected Mercedes to come back strongly and that consistency is key.
""I think these things always balance out over the course of a year,"" he said of Leclerc's engine-related retirement while leading from pole position on Sunday.
""They've been unfortunate today, we were unfortunate in two races. The championships are extremely tight and it's still early days.
""It's going to continue to be a factor through the season. From what I hear both Mercedes were on the limit water-wise as well at the end of the race.

The Williams driver had spent a year away from the grand prix grid after being replaced at Red Bull by Mexican Sergio Perez but has seized his new opportunity with determination.
The 26-year-old British-born Thai finished 10th in Australia, acclaimed by the team as a ""tyre whisperer"" after starting last and making one set of hard tyres last 56 laps at Melbourne's Albert Park, and came ninth in Miami.
Monaco this weekend could continue his record of scoring at circuits starting with M.
""Going into this year I wanted to prove people wrong,"" Albon told Reuters in Barcelona last weekend.
""I wanted to show my fortitude and show people, I guess, redemption really. 
""I’ve always felt like I’ve been able to drive a car quickly and now I feel given another chance with more experience and a bit more knowledge about the global side of Formula One, and that comes from everything.""
Albon hesitated to call himself Alex 2.0 but said he had used his time away, racing in the German Touring Car championship (DTM) and as an embedded Red Bull F1 reserve driver, to learn and grow.
He focused on areas he felt needed work and set himself clear targets.
""A lot of what I was doing was on the simulator and communicating with the engineers in understanding very simply what makes the car quick,"" he said.
""And so it is a feeling like I’ve come into this year prepared and in a better place mentally as well than I was in 2020.
""At the same time I also feel like 2020 gets a bit more flak than it (deserves). It was a tough year of course but when I look at it now, with the hindsight I do have, I was very inexperienced at that time.""
Albon got a call from Red Bull's Toro Rosso team in November 2018, just when he was headed for the electric Formula E series, and graduated to Red Bull midway through 2019 in a swap with a struggling Pierre Gasly.
He was dropped as Max Verstappen's team mate when Red Bull decided Perez would offer stronger support for Verstappen.
At Williams, Albon has fitted in well as a popular replacement for George Russell, now at Mercedes, alongside  Canadian Nicholas Latifi. He has also kept his Red Bull links.
""At the start of the season we were a little bit on the back foot but we’ve done some big things,"" he said. ""I feel like if we can find that next little bit, we’ll be right there regularly with the McLarens, the AlphaTauris.""

The 42-year-old will drive a Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 for the Team Trackhouse squad for the NASCAR Cup road course race at Watkins Glen International on Aug 21.
Team Trackhouse, owned by ex-racer Justin Marks and popular rapper Pitbull, are targeting more drivers from outside NASCAR to take over one of their cars as part of an initiative called Project 91.
""I wasn't looking to race again, but Justin came to my home in Switzerland and convinced me how serious he was about putting together a top-notch program,"" Raikkonen said in a news release.
""This will be fun, but it's something I will take very seriously. I know how competitive the NASCAR Cup Series is and it will be a big challenge.""

67,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/leclerc-says-past-failures-monaco-are-no-pressure-2710126,Leclerc says past failures in Monaco are no pressure,"MONACO: Charles Leclerc carries a burden of expectation into Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix, and a nightmare track record on city streets he has known all his life, but the Ferrari driver denies feeling the pressure.
The 24-year-old Monegasque was leading the Formula One championship by 19 points in Spain last weekend, and set for the race victory, until he was halted by a power unit problem.
That handed the overall lead to Red Bull's reigning champion Max Verstappen, who won in Monaco last year after Leclerc was unable to start from pole position. The Dutch driver now has a six-point advantage.
Since his debut in 2018, Leclerc has yet to score a point at home.
This year he was won twice and been on pole four times in six races and could finally become the first Monegasque to score points at home since Louis Chiron finished third in 1950.
The Ferrari fans have hung their banners out, fervently hoping this is the year to end the jinx.
""I don't think about it,"" Leclerc told reporters at the harbourside paddock on Thursday. ""Of course, it's not been the luckiest track for me overall but it's life, it happens... sometimes things just don't go your way.
""I'll just take the same approach as I've done in the first few races of 2022 because it's been successful until now.""
Leclerc said his accident in the final minutes of qualifying last year, which led to a driveshaft failure before he could take his place on Sunday's starting grid, was just down to trying too hard.
He was confident the Barcelona problem would not happen again.
""Honestly, I don't feel the added pressure of bigger responsibility this year than any other years,"" he said.
""Last year also and the year before it was also my, or our, responsibility to get back on top with such a big name as Ferrari.
""I just try and focus on the job and am confident that whenever we do the perfect job on the weekend we have a shot for a win this year.""
Verstappen has won the last three races, taking almost maximum points, but has yet to win four in a row in Formula One. Like Leclerc, he also had a poor record in the principality until 2021.
""My Monaco race history was not so good but I finally won there last year and there was a massive relief once I crossed the line,"" he said.
Mercedes and seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton could also be a factor, the champions back on the rise after struggling with a bouncing car.
""Monaco hasn't always been our happiest track, and slow-speed corners haven't been our strength this season as we saw in Barcelona, but we've seen so far this year that anything can happen,"" said team boss Toto Wolff.","['67_0', '67_1']","[""\n      Formula One F1 - Monaco Grand Prix - Circuit de Monaco, Monte Carlo, Monaco - May 26, 2022 Ferrari's Charles Leclerc ahead of the Grand Prix REUTERS/Benoit Tessier\n    "", ""\n      Formula One F1 - Monaco Grand Prix - Circuit de Monaco, Monte Carlo, Monaco - May 26, 2022 Ferrari's Charles Leclerc ahead of the Grand Prix REUTERS/Benoit Tessier\n    ""]"

MONACO
This year’s race is the 68th edition in championship history and 79th since the first grand prix in the principality in 1929.
The late triple world champion Ayrton Senna holds the record for most Monaco wins - six, including five in a row with McLaren between 1989 and 1993.
A safety car deployment is highly likely.
Ferrari have won nine times in total but McLaren are the most successful in Monaco, with 15 wins since their debut in 1966.
In 1996, Frenchman Olivier Panis won from 14th on the starting grid - the lowest winning start position to date. Since 1950, only 10 times has the race been won by a driver starting lower than third.
Thirty of the winners have started on pole.
Five former Monaco winners will be on Sunday’s grid:  Fernando Alonso (2006, 2007), Hamilton (2008, 2016, 2019), Sebastian Vettel (2011, 2017), Daniel Ricciardo (2018) and Verstappen (2021).
Leclerc can become the first Monegasque to score points at home since Louis Chiron finished third in 1950. He failed to start last year after securing pole.
RACE WINS
Verstappen has won the last three races and four of the season's six races, Leclerc the other two.
Hamilton has a record 103 wins from 294 starts. He has yet to win this year, however, and his most recent was in Saudi Arabia last December.
Ferrari have won 240 races since 1950, McLaren 183, Mercedes 124, Williams 115 and Red Bull 79.
POLE POSITION
Leclerc has been on pole four times this year, with Red Bull's Sergio Perez and Verstappen taking the other two.
Hamilton has a record 103 career poles, most recently qualifying fastest in Saudi Arabia last year.
FASTEST LAP
Leclerc took the fastest lap bonus point in the first three races, Verstappen in Imola and Miami and Perez in Spain.
POINTS
Verstappen leads Leclerc by six points.
Red Bull lead Ferrari by 26 points in the constructors' standings.
Mercedes' George Russell is the only driver to have scored points in every race this year. The Briton has finished all in the top five.

65,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/johnson-changing-lanes-indianapolis-500-2710721,Johnson changing lanes at Indianapolis 500,"INDIANAPOLIS :     For a long time motor racers stuck to their lanes, but increasingly drivers like Jimmie Johnson are heading in new directions in search of racing thrills.
A seven-time NASCAR Cup champion, Johnson put down a well-beaten path to the stock car series winner's circle, but on Sunday he will take on the Brickyard's notorious oval for the first time in a bid to join AJ Foyt and Mario Andretti as the only drivers to win both the Indy and Daytona 500s.
The pull of new adventures can bring purpose to accomplished drivers like the 46-year-old Johnson who is not viewing the Indy 500 as a one-off but a launch pad to a second career.
""I'm loving this experience, loving IndyCar,"" said Johnson, who qualified 12th for Sunday's 106th Indy 500. ""I would stick around as long as I could. 
""I don't know what that number would be, I hope this isn't my one and only Indianapolis 500 start, I hope this isn't my one and only full-time season in the IndyCar Series either. 
""I don't know what that looks like but I am going to do everything in my power to be doing this for years to come.""
The jump from Formula One to IndyCar is not a great leap. Many drivers from Mario Andretti to Jacques Villeneuve and Romain Grosjean have made the move.
There are other avenues open to more and more drivers, with many dabbling in sportscars, some attracted to rallying and a few intrigued by NASCAR.
Former Formula One world champion Kimi Raikkonen is just the latest, announcing on Thursday he will make his return to racing in August in the NASCAR Cup Series at Watkins Glen.
For a few drivers a change is an opportunity to make history.
Formula One double-world champion Fernando Alonso famously left the glamour circuit in pursuit of motor racing's triple crown of victories at the Monaco Grand Prix, Le Mans 24 Hours and the Indianapolis 500.
The Spaniard won Monaco (twice) and Le Mans but failed twice at his bid for the Indy 500 before returning to Formula One with French outfit Alpine
Aside from aiming to become just the third driver to win the Daytona and Indy 500s, Johnson is also flirting with the idea of another rare motor racing double - running both the Indianapolis 500 and NASCAR's Coca Cola 600 which are held the same day.
""It's always been an interest of mine,"" admitted Johnson. ""I don't have anything in motion but just admired it from afar over the years watching John Andretti do it once, and Kurt (Busch) do it once and Tony Stewart do it.""
""It's always been on my radar, Not sure if it can ever happen but certainly would be something I am open to it.""

The 91-year-old Briton, now in Portugal, told Reuters a ""silly, tiny little incident"" had caused a lot of aggravation as he and his family tried to leave Sao Paulo by private plane on Wednesday night.
""I haven't had any publicity lately and I thought I ought to do something to get some,"" he joked in a telephone conversation.
Sao Paulo state public security office confirmed in a statement to Reuters on Thursday that a businessman was arrested for possession of a firearm at Campinas' airport, but did not name him directly..
""I was never arrested,"" said Ecclestone, who confirmed that he had to pay 6,060 reais ($1,260) bail before being allowed to leave.
""They wanted it in local currency which we never had,"" he added. ""So there was another drama trying to find the money. I was leaving the country, I didn't have any local money.
""It was a bleeding drama, unnecessary, over a nothing."" 
Ecclestone said he had bought the handgun, a LW Seecamp .32, from a Formula One mechanic or tyre man in Brazil years ago without ammunition and purely as a deterrent.
""They said you need something like this,"" he explained. ""It might work if someone tried to mug you or something. So I bought it from the guy.
""I had it in the house and used to muck around with it if people came to visit me or something, we would joke around,"" he added. 
Ecclestone said he had left it in a shirt pocket and the people packing his luggage put it in a suitcase without being aware of the gun.
An airport scan then revealed the gun, which had not been registered.
""It was never going to be shot, it never had any bullets so I never bothered to register it. I didn't know you had to,"" said Ecclestone.
The billionaire said he then spent from 8pm until 5am at the airport making statements and completing paperwork before leaving in the morning.
Ecclestone is married to Brazilian-born Fabiana Ecclestone, an FIA vice-president and member of the World Motor Sport Council.
Her mother Aparecida Schunck was kidnapped in Sao Paulo in 2016, with criminals demanding 120 million reais ($25.07 million) in ransom before she was freed nine days later in a police raid without any money being paid.

63,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/fia-extends-formula-one-jewellery-exemption-end-june-2711841,FIA extends Formula One jewellery exemption to end of June,"MONACO :     Seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton will be able to continue racing with piercings for the next three races after Formula One's governing body extended an exemption on fixed items of jewellery.
The FIA confirmed the push back until the end of June for items requiring special intervention for removal, with the medical commission evaluating feedback from drivers and others.
The period covers this weekend's showcase Monaco Grand Prix, the races in Azerbaijan on June 12 and Canada on June 19 and expires before Mercedes driver Hamilton's home race at Silverstone on July 3.
Hamilton, the sport's most successful driver with 103 wins, has said he cannot remove one of his piercings without assistance.
He was given a two-race exemption after a standoff at this month's Miami Grand Prix, which would have meant breaching the regulations in Monaco if he failed to remove the piercings before then.
""Honestly I feel there’s way too much time and energy been given to this,"" the 37-year-old driver told reporters in Monaco on Friday. 
""I’ve said everything I feel I need to say. I’ve taken the (ear) studs out every time I’ve been in the car.""
""I think we’ve all worn jewellery our whole careers in F1 and it’s never been a problem in the past and there’s no reason for it to necessarily be a problem now.""
The Briton said it was positive to be working with the FIA on reaching a solution but ""we shouldn’t have to keep revisiting this subject every weekend, we have bigger fish to fry.""
The ban on jewellery, as well as the wearing of non-compliant under-garments, has long been in the rules but rarely enforced until the FIA clamped down this season.
It says items beneath the mandatory flameproof clothing could increase the risk of burn injuries and has highlighted the risk of critical delays or complications if medical imaging is required following an accident.

The Mediterranean principality is in contract discussions amid plenty of debate about the future of the showcase race on a crowded calendar set to expand to other alluring venues such as Las Vegas.
There has been speculation the race, part of the fabric of the sport since the first world championship season in 1950, could alternate.
""I don't think anyone's got the balls to take that race away from Monaco,"" Ecclestone told Reuters.
He said he had spoken to Automobile Club de Monaco president Michel Boeri on Thursday.
""They are still super, super happy and confident with everything without any drama. So I don't see any problems there at all,"" he added.
Ecclestone said it would be a mistake to make the race biennial.
""Whether it's the worst race or the best race or whatever, it's the crown jewels,"" he said.
Ecclestone, who for decades drew up the calendar and introduced new races to the sport, said he regularly heard promoters explain how they were going to do things better than Monaco.
""Look at Miami. That wasn't a Formula One race,"" added the 91-year-old. ""It could have been a local club race, couldn't it.
""They had those boats in the car park, trying to make it look like Monaco.""
The venue for this month's inaugural race, around the grounds of the Miami Dolphins' Hard Rock Stadium, featured a ""Beach Club"" without a beach and a ""Marina"" without water.
There were real yachts, but sitting on concrete blocks above a special vinyl surface designed to look like gently rolling waves for the television cameras.
The real Monaco features cars racing around the tight metal-fenced street circuit against a backdrop of superyachts moored in the harbour.

Leclerc led team mate Carlos Sainz in a one-two in the second session, lapping the unforgiving street circuit with a fastest lap of one minute 12.656 seconds on a hot and sunny afternoon.
He was 0.044 quicker than the Spaniard, with the local favourite also fastest in a crash-free first practice with a time of 1:14.531.
Red Bull's Formula One championship leader Max Verstappen was fourth in both sessions, with team mate Sergio Perez second and third. 
Leclerc, 24, took pole position for the race last year but was unable to start due to a driveshaft problem, with Verstappen going on to win.
The Monegasque is six points behind Verstappen after retiring from last weekend's Spanish Grand Prix but hoping to take back the lead on Sunday and become the first driver from the principality to score points at home since Louis Chiron finished third in 1950.
Lando Norris was fifth in both sessions for McLaren, after resting this week to recover from tonsillitis.
RED FLAGS
Ricciardo, winner with Red Bull in 2018, failed to set a time in the second after crashing into the barriers at the Swimming Pool chicane and bringing out the red flags with 45 minutes remaining.
He was already under pressure after McLaren boss Zak Brown said the Australian, who won at Monza last year, was not generally meeting the team's expectations.
George Russell was the fastest Mercedes driver in sixth place in the second session, with seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton 10th and 12th and testing a range of settings to tame his bouncing car.
""It's so bouncy out here, man I am losing my mind,"" said the Briton during the opening stint.
""I need elbow pads in this cockpit it's bouncing so much.""
Mercedes boss Toto Wolff had warned earlier in the week that the seventh race of the 22-round season could be a tricky one for his team.
""Monaco hasn't always been our happiest track, and slow-speed corners haven't been our strength this season as we saw in Barcelona,"" he said, referring to the previous race in Spain last weekend.  
Mick Schumacher stopped his Haas on track with a gearbox problem in the first session but returned for the second as did   Alfa Romeo's Valtteri Bottas, who failed to complete a lap earlier due to technical problems.

The 22-year-old scored on his debut in Bahrain in March, finishing 10th, but has since had two 11th places and a 15th as well as mechanically-related retirements in his last two outings.
Vasseur said the team messed up in Saudi Arabia, while technical issues stopped him scoring in Miami and Spain, but Zhou had reached the second phase of qualifying in five out of six races.
""We gave him the target to be in Q2 and except Miami for traffic reasons he was always in Q2,"" said Vasseur in a recent interview with Reuters. 
""In the first two or three events he was even fighting at some stages with Lewis (Hamilton). 
""He is a very good racer. Even in Miami before the issue of the cooling he overtook (Mercedes') George Russell and then he was fighting with (McLaren's Daniel) Ricciardo.
""He is at the level that nobody expected before... he’s doing very strong races, very consistent, he’s doing a strong job on the tyre management and the performance is there.
""I remember perfectly the comments - very harsh, stupid and bad comments - when he signed last year and I think that when he was fighting with Ricciardo, Lewis or Russell that he was able to show to everybody that they were stupid.""
Zhou, who brings funding from Chinese backers, arrived at Alfa after finishing third in Formula Two last season.
Australian Oscar Piastri, the champion, and Ferrari-backed second placed Russian Robert Shwartzman have yet to make the leap.
Vasseur said Zhou was a strong team player but he did not want to take a decision about the future until September.
The Chinese is paired with Finn Valtteri Bottas at Alfa, with the former Mercedes driver scoring 38 points and just eight fewer than seven times world champion Hamilton.
Vasseur did not want the Finn to be distracted by that, however.
""I am trying to keep Valtteri away from this kind of approach because we are not fighting with Mercedes, we are not fighting with Lewis,"" he said. ""We are fighting with all the other teams.
""It’s also important for us but mainly for Valtteri to avoid thinking about Mercedes and Lewis. It’s quite natural when you are coming from a team and going to another one to have a look at what your ex team is doing, but it would be a mistake.""

The glitzy principality on the Mediterranean coast has staged Formula One's signature race since the first world championship season in 1950 but Brown indicated that unless Monaco is willing to reach a commercial agreement more in line with other races it risks being dropped from the schedule.
""I think Monaco has had a very advantageous commercial agreement with Formula One forever and I think all Formula One is trying to do is get a commercial agreement in place that is more consistent with the other venues while recognising its importance on the calendar,"" Brown said on Friday.
""But I think Formula One is now the size and scope that it is bigger than any one team, any one driver, any one race."" , he added at the Indianapolis 500 where McLaren Arrow will have three cars on the starting grid for Sunday's race.
While it would seem unthinkable that Formula One would seriously consider dropping its most popular event, Brown said there are plenty of venues offering glamour lined up and ready to step in at the price Formula One is asking.
""Of course, none of us want to see Monaco go but also understand that as a commercial rights holder they need to have an arrangement more consistent with the other venues given the demand of tracks that want to host grand prix,"" said Brown.
Formula One recently added two U.S. races that pack a glitzy punch in Las Vegas and Miami. Las Vegas is set to come on line next year, while Miami made its debut earlier in May racing around the grounds of the Miami Dolphins' Hard Rock Stadium.

Castroneves exploded onto the IndyCar scene by winning the 500 on his first two tries in 2001 and 2002. He completed the hat-trick in 2009.
But it took 12 years to bag number four and at 46-years-old the window is closing for the charismatic Brazilian to make Brickyard history.
""I want it a lot. I want to do something nobody ever did,"" said Castroneves, who joined AJ Foyt, Rick Mears and Al Unser as a four-time winner. ""I've tied the record, now it would be phenomenal to do something nobody has ever done. 
""Am I going to fight for it? Absolutely.
""Is it going to happen, we are going to see on Sunday.
""I dream about it. I think about it..""
While it is nice to dream, the reality is Castroneves will start 27th - near the back of the 33-car field in a car that has not shown it is capable of running up front.
BIGGEST ROADBLOCK
Perhaps the biggest roadblock in his drive-for-five is a powerhouse Chip Ganassi Racing outfit which will have five drivers near the front led by Scott Dixon, snatching pole with a record speed of 234 mph.
The 'Iceman' also started from pole in 2008 when he claimed his only Indy 500 win.
Starting alongside the New Zealander will be his young Spanish team mate Alex Palou, runner-up at last year's 500, while Row Two will have two more Ganassi employees in Swede Marcus Ericsson and Brazilian Tony Kanaan.
Not far back in row four is Jimmie Johnson, the seven-time NASCAR Cup champion seen as a dark horse pick despite making his Indy 500 debut.
""I think we have a good mix of some veterans and also some younger guys,"" said Dixon, a six-time IndyCar champion who sits third on the all-time win list with 51.
""The team Chip and everybody has put together is very unselfish but also have the common goal to just want to win. 
""That's hard to come by and keep that as an even keel. Right now is probably is one of the times where I have seen the whole team all smiling.
""That's hard to achieve with two or three cars, it's difficult with five - really tough.""
OLD GUARD
IndyCar has seen a pack of hard-charging newcomers emerge over the last two seasons but when it comes to the Indy 500 the old guard has been less willing to pass the torch.
Palou, at 25-years-old is the reigning drivers champion while Arrow McLaren's Pato O'Ward and Andretti Autosports's Colton Herta all posted multiple wins last season and have attracted interest from Formula One.
But at the notorious Brickyard experience, bravery and smarts count and there will be plenty of it on Sunday's grid.
Polesitter Dixon is 41 while team mate Johnson is 46 as is Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya. Kanaan and Castroneves are 47.
Dixon, Kanaan, Montoya and Castroneves all have at least one Indy 500 victory on their resumes while Johnson has won the Daytona 500 twice.
Frenchman Romain Grosjean, 36, brings a different type of experience to his first Indy 500 having made 179 Formula One starts before moving to IndyCar.
""I feel experience is an advantage,"" said Castroneves. ""Still going to be very difficult but I feel we can do it.""

Carlos Sainz was third for Ferrari, with Red Bull's Formula One championship leader Max Verstappen fourth.
On a sunny afternoon in the Mediterranean principality, Perez's best lap of one minute 12.476 seconds was 0.041 quicker than Leclerc, with Sainz 0.370 off the pace.
Verstappen leads Leclerc by six points after six races, with the Ferrari driver seeking to become the first Monegasque to score points at home since Louis Chiron finished third in 1950.
AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly was fifth and Lando Norris, recovering from tonsillitis, sixth for McLaren despite clipping the wall.
Seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton was seventh fastest for Mercedes, with team mate George Russell ninth.
Aston Martin's Lance Stroll hit the wall after bouncing off a kerb.

56,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/no-female-drivers-indy-500-second-time-three-years-2714056,No female drivers in Indy 500 for second time in three years,"INDIANAPOLIS :     The Indianapolis 500 was once the land of opportunity for women racers but for the second time in three years their will be no female drivers on the starting grid at the Brickyard when the green flag is dropped on Sunday.
Pioneers such as Janet Guthrie, who became the first woman to start an Indy 500 in 1977, have left their mark on motorsport but progress recently has been more slow motion than fast track when it comes to the ""Greatest Spectacle in Racing"".
In 2010 and 2011, with four women sprinkled across the 33 car fields, IndyCar appeared to be on the road to diversity that other sports were just coming to grips with.
Danica Patrick, the first and only woman to win an IndyCar race, had become the sport's most recognisable and marketable name, a crossover star with appeal beyond the race track.
But that progress has stalled. The 2020 Indy 500 was the first without at least one woman in the field since 1999 and this year's race will mark a second shutout in three years.
Patrick is back at Indianapolis Motor Speedway this week but as a television commentator.
So is Sarah Fisher, the first woman to win an IndyCar pole, who will be on the track on Sunday but behind the wheel of the pace car.
""There should be more women in the sport for sure, certainly in a place like this,"" said Graham Rahal, who is married to former drag racer Courtney Force.  ""We need to generate more opportunities to help and find sponsors.""
While there will be no women on the Indy 500 grid there will be a few at other IndyCar tracks this season.
Colombian Tatiana Calderon, a test driver for Alfa Romeo Formula One, is competing on the road and street courses for AJ Foyt Racing while Swiss Simona De Silvestro, who has been part of six Indy 500s, is back with Paretta Autosport, an all-woman outfit that will team up with Ed Carpenter Racing to run in three events.
""I know they have big plans, big goals to make sure they are back here for future Indy 500s,"" Carpenter, a three-time Indy 500 pole sitter who will line up fourth on Sunday, told Reuters.
""I think it has to happen the right way. Just putting something together to say that we have a female starting the race, I don't think that is necessarily the point.
""We'll see what the future brings.""
For the Della Penna Motorsports Next Gen Foundation, the place to start is the grassroots which means carting, the entry point into sport for everyone from Formula One seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton to Danica Patrick.
The foundation recently set up two advisory councils to support its mission to empower girls aged five to 16, creating a talent pipeline that provides motorsport career opportunities on and off the track.
""It is definitely grassroots for sure,"" founder Michelle Della Penna told Reuters. ""The goal is to get girls interested at a young age and expose them to the different possible careers motorsport can offer.
""Women are just as exciting to watch as men so if we can start to have the advertising and sponsorship dollars to support them I think we will see a real change.""

55,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/mclaren-put-senna-logo-dropped-williams-their-halo-2714746,"McLaren put Senna logo, dropped by Williams, on their halo","MONACO :     McLaren have given a permanent home on their cars to a logo paying tribute to late Formula One great Ayrton Senna after rivals Williams removed it at the start of the season.
The Brazilian won all three of his titles with McLaren before his death in a Williams at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.
The Williams cars had carried various versions of the Senna logo, from a trademark 'S' to special-edition stickers, since 1995 but the team changed owners in 2020 and founder Frank Williams died last year.
""We feel it's right that we, as McLaren, should recognise his contribution to our sport by carrying his name with us wherever we go racing,"" said McLaren Racing chief executive Zak Brown in a statement.
Monaco, a race Senna won six times including five in a row for McLaren between 1989 and 1993, marks the start of the initiative with the Senna name and S placed on the base of the halo head protection device.
""Seeing the Senna logo on a McLaren is an amazing feeling,"" said Senna's nephew Bruno. ""We have a rich history together as a family and as a team, and it is very important to us that the logo is always in F1.""
Brown said the addition, with the support of the Senna family, would be permanent and he could not think of a better race than Monaco to recognise Senna.
""It will serve as a constant reminder of Ayrton Senna's sensational talent for us as a team, and for all our fans around the world,"" added the American.

54,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/fia-defends-handling-delayed-monaco-gp-2714896,FIA defends handling of delayed Monaco GP,"MONACO: Formula One's governing body defended the handling of the showcase Monaco Grand Prix after rain delayed the start for more than an hour on Sunday, and a crash then caused another long stoppage.
Some fans on social media were scathing, questioning why the world's top drivers could not be let loose in the wet conditions and recalling previous races in the principality held in torrential downpours.
Mercedes's seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton, who had said after Saturday's qualifying that he hoped rain would mix things up, said he had wanted to go racing.
""We are Formula One drivers, so that is definitely not a good reason,"" the Briton said when told the delay was because there had been no practice running on wet tyres earlier in the weekend.
""I was, like, let’s go when it was just drizzling a little bit at the beginning. We will talk about it in the drivers’ briefing but we should have started the race,"" he said.
A spokesman for the governing FIA said a long second delay had been caused by a power outage, knocking out start systems.
The decision to hold rolling starts, rather than standing ones, was because some drivers would have been disadvantaged by wet asphalt when others were on the dry.
The stoppage after Mick Schumacher crashed was for safety reasons, with the barrier needing to be repaired. The race was ultimately shortened to 64 laps from 77.
Formula One has two race directors sharing duties after previous incumbent Michael Masi was removed following a safety car controversy at the 2021 season-ender in Abu Dhabi that decided the outcome of the championship.
On Sunday, drivers did two formation laps behind the safety car before red flags were waved and the cars returned to the pits.
""It's raining like crazy,"" Ferrari pole-sitter and local favourite Charles Leclerc said over team radio before the race director called the halt.
The start was originally scheduled for 1500 local but the formation lap was delayed to 1509, when the rain was not heavy, and then 1516 behind the safety car as conditions deteriorated.
The race finally started at 1605 local, with the field doing a further formation lap behind the safety car.
Red Bull team boss Christian Horner, whose Mexican driver Sergio Perez won the race with championship leader Max Verstappen third, suggested they could have got going at the appointed time.
He said it was correct to stop it later, however.
Monaco is famous for a lack of overtaking on the tight and twisty streets but slippery conditions make the chances of a mistake far greater.",['54_0'],"[""\nFerrari's Charles Leclerc during the formation lap. (Photo: REUTERS/Benoit Tessier)\n""]"
53,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/ericsson-holds-oward-two-lap-shootout-win-indy-500-2714906,Ericsson holds off O'Ward in two-lap shootout to win Indy 500,"INDIANAPOLIS :Sweden's Marcus Ericsson prevailed in a two-lap shootout to win a dramatic Indianapolis 500 on Sunday as the Brickyard reclaimed the mantle of the world's biggest single day sporting event, living up to its billing as the 'Greatest Spectacle in Racing"".
On a day of twists and turns on the 2.5 mile oval, the biggest came just six laps from the end when Jimmie Johnson got down on the grass and spun up into the wall, bringing out a red flag and sending the cars onto the pit lane.
When the debris was cleared, the drivers returned to the track and with over 300,000 spectators on their feet for a breathtaking two-lap winner-takes-all sprint, Ericsson held off hard-charging Mexican Pato O'Ward to put his car on Victory Lane and give owner Chip Ganaasi a fifth Borg Warner trophy.
Ericsson, who spent five years in Formula One making 97 starts without a podium before moving to IndyCar, becomes the second Swede to win the Indy 500 after Kenny Brack in 1999.
""I did almost 100 Grand Prix running for small teams towards back most of it,"" said Ericsson. ""You don't get a lot of credit running in the back. Formula One people think you are not very good.
""Moved here and put my whole life into trying to become an IndyCar and Indianapolis 500 champion. It has been tough, it has been not easy, but I have been working extremely hard and it feels good to show hard work pays off.""    
With five cars in the race, including pole sitter Scott Dixon, many expected to see a Chip Ganassi Racing driver grab the win but few predicted it would be Ericsson, the least celebrated of the all-star stable.
But after Dixon made a late pit stop blunder, Alex Palou, the defending IndyCar Series champion, suffered bad luck, and Johnson crashed, Ericsson stepped up to seize his chance and was joined on the podium by another team mate Tony Kanaan in third.
O'Ward, who extended his contract with Arrow McLaren on Friday, shot up alongside Ericsson as the two cars charged into the final lap but could not get past the Swede, who had just enough speed to hold on for a third career win.
""Whenever the restart happened I had one shot, I had to go flat out and it still wasn't enough,"" said O'Ward. ""So sadly they had the faster car.
""I'm proud of the job we did today, it's my best result in the 500. It's just a bit of a tough pill to swallow after such a long race.""    
SPEEDING PENALTY
No driver will have a harder time digesting the result than Dixon.
The New Zealander had been running out front most of the day and appeared poised to collect a second Indy 500 win until the 'The Iceman' made a fatal mistake on the final scheduled pit stop, taking a stop and go penalty for speeding.
Palou, who started alongside Dixon on the front row, was also left frustrated when he was sent to the back of the pack after coming into the closed pits for an emergency service and sent to the back of the field for the restart.     
Helio Castroneves, who joined the Brickyard's exclusive club of four-time champions last year, came into the race looking to make history as the first to win five and mounted a late charge but could not get in the final fight, finishing seventh.
After COVID-19 forced spectator restrictions on the previous two 500s, the crowd on Sunday was the largest in the last 20 years with the exception of the 100th running in 2016.
Nobody was more excited to see the fans back in force than Roger Penske, who completed his purchase of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and IndyCar Series in 2019, just before COVID-19 shut down global sport.
There would have been no better way to celebrate than the Team Penske owner putting one of his three entries on Victory Lane for a record-extending 19th time but his top finisher was Josef Newgarden placing 13th.

52,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/perez-wins-rain-delayed-and-red-flagged-monaco-gp-2715016,Perez wins rain-delayed and red-flagged Monaco GP,"MONACO: Sergio Perez won a rain-delayed, crash-halted and ultimately nail-biting Monaco Grand Prix for Red Bull on Sunday (May 29) to make his dream come true as another evaporated for Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.
The Mexican's team mate Max Verstappen finished third to stretch his Formula One championship lead over Leclerc, who was fourth, to nine points after seven of 22 races.
Ferrari's Carlos Sainz was second, for the second year in succession.
Leclerc had started on pole position but Ferrari were outsmarted on strategy and he was leapfrogged by the Red Bull drivers in the pitstops.
He at least ended a home jinx to become the first Monegasque to score in Monaco since Louis Chiron finished third in 1950, the year the championship began, but the race had promised so much more.
The win was the third of Perez's career and second for Red Bull, and it ended with a thrilling chase on a treacherous street circuit where the difference between success and failure is measured in millimetres.
The top four at the chequered flag were separated by a mere 2.9 seconds.
""This is us! Come on, vamos,"" screamed Perez as he crossed the finish line 1.1 seconds ahead of Sainz with Verstappen a further 0.3 behind.
""It's a dream come true,"" he said. ""After your home race it's the most special race to win.""
The showcase race, whose future is being increasingly questioned as Formula One expands to new venues in the Americas and Middle East, was twice red-flagged and shortened from 77 scheduled laps to 64 after running out of time.
Perez was only the third driver to win a race this season, with Verstappen winning four of the previous six and Leclerc the other two.
Verstappen, who had been chasing a fourth win in a row, now has 125 points to Leclerc's 116 with Perez on 110.
Red Bull forged 36 points clear of Ferrari in the constructors' standings.
George Russell was fifth for Mercedes, ahead of McLaren's Lando Norris and Alpine's Fernando Alonso.
Seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton took eighth for Mercedes, with Valtteri Bottas ninth for Alfa Romeo and Sebastian Vettel 10th for Aston Martin.
The race started after more than an hour's delay, with the safety car guiding the field around for formation laps on the wet asphalt before peeling off into the pits as Leclerc led the rolling start.
The Monegasque stayed ahead until lap 18, when he pitted to change from wet tyres to intermediates and found himself behind Perez, who had come in a lap earlier and made the 'undercut' work, and Sainz.
An angry Leclerc dropped to fourth after Ferrari called him in again for slicks and then told him, too late, to stay out after Sainz also pitted and went directly from wets to the dry tyres.
Red Bull successfully double-stacked their drivers, with the order settling at Perez leading, ahead of Sainz, Verstappen and Leclerc.
The safety car was again deployed on lap 27 after Mick Schumacher crashed his Haas heavily at the exit to the swimming pool complex, the car spinning into the barriers and splitting in two.
""I'm okay,"" gasped the 23-year-old German, whose Ferrari great father Michael was a five-times winner in Monaco, over the car radio.
The race was then halted on the 30th lap, before a rolling re-start 20 minutes later, as marshals repaired the Tecpro energy-absorbing barrier that had been bent out of shape.
Schumacher's Danish team mate Kevin Magnussen had already retired from a surprisingly lively race, with AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly making two strong overtakes on a track where passing is famously difficult.
Hamilton and Alpine's Esteban Ocon collided without major consequence on lap 18 as the Briton tried to pass for eighth place. Ocon was given a five-second penalty that ultimately cost him ninth place.","['52_0', '52_1', '52_2']","[""\n      Formula One F1 - Monaco Grand Prix - Circuit de Monaco, Monte Carlo, Monaco - May 29, 2022 Red Bull's Sergio Perez celebrates after winning the race REUTERS/Benoit Tessier\n    "", ""\n      Formula One F1 - Monaco Grand Prix - Circuit de Monaco, Monte Carlo, Monaco - May 29, 2022 Red Bull's Sergio Perez celebrates on the podium after winning the race as Prince Albert II of Monaco applauds REUTERS/Benoit Tessier\n    "", ""\n      Formula One F1 - Monaco Grand Prix - Circuit de Monaco, Monte Carlo, Monaco - May 29, 2022 Red Bull's Sergio Perez in action during the race REUTERS/Benoit Tessier\n    ""]"

Verstappen, the world championship leader, finished third with Ferrari rival Charles Leclerc fourth. The Monegasque started on pole position but slipped nine points behind the Dutchman.
Both Red Bull drivers were accused of failing to obey pit-lane exit rules after a pitstop during the race but the stewards dismissed both protests.
""At the hearing Ferrari conceded that Car 11 (Perez) did not have any part of its front or rear tyres on the left of the yellow line and conceded that the protest was unfounded,"" the stewards said in a statement.
""The protest is therefore dismissed and the protest fee is forfeited.""
The race director's notes state that drivers must keep to the right of the solid yellow line at the pit exit when leaving the pits and stay to the right of the line until it finishes after turn one.
""We believe there was a clear breach of the regulations by the two Red Bulls going on the yellow line exiting the pits,"" Ferrari team boss Mattia Binotto had told Sky Sports television after the race.

On a team that includes six-time IndyCar champion and 2008 Indy 500 winner Scott Dixon, seven-time NASCAR Cup drivers champion Jimmie Johnson, 2013 Indy 500 winner Tony Kanaan and the current IndyCar champion Alex Palou, the unassuming Ericsson was - that other guy.
No longer.
After a fearless effort that saw Ericsson prevail in a two-lap shootout with Pato O'Ward to win a dramatic Indianapolis 500 on Sunday the 31-year-old Swede finds himself on the front pages.
""When you have Dixie (Scott Dixon) and TK (Tony Kanaan) and JJ (Jimmie Johnson) and Palou, the defending champion, the focus will be on them for sure,"" said Ericsson. ""Maybe after today it will change a bit.""
Ericsson's life is about to change - a lot.
Early on Monday morning there is a meeting with the sculptor who will put his likeness on the Borg Warner trophy followed by a team photo shoot at the Brickyard finish line.
There will be other media opportunities and then a black tie awards dinner.
He will be whisked off to New York for more media commitments, guest appearances on early morning and late night talk shows and glad handing with sponsor. 
And oh yes, there is a race next weekend in Detroit where Ericsson can expect to be in high demand.
""They say it is life changing winning this race,"" smiled Ericsson. ""Coming to IndyCar one of my goals was to show what I could do, show my skills because I felt in F1 I didn't get a chance to do that. So I came here.
""The first couple of years were pretty tough, took some time to get use to this type of racing.""
The spotlight is an unfamiliar place for the thoughtful Swede, who has raced on some of the sport's biggest stages but almost always in the shadows. 
He spent five season in Formula One but maintained that there was little glamour or respect toiling at the back of the grid as he did make 97 starts for tailenders Caterham and Sauber, never setting foot on a podium.
""I did almost 100 Grand Prix running for small teams towards the back most of it,"" said Ericsson. ""You don't get a lot of credit running in the back, Formula One people think you are not very good. 
""I moved here and put my whole life into trying to become a IndyCar and Indianapolis 500 champion. 
""It's been tough but I have been working extremely hard and it feels good to show hard work pays off.""

49,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/proud-perez-lives-dream-and-makes-history-mexico-2715601,Proud Perez lives a dream and makes history for Mexico,"MONACO :     Sergio Perez celebrated a dream Monaco Grand Prix win on Sunday and made history as Mexico's all-time most successful Formula One driver.
The 32-year-old now has three career victories, one more than the late Pedro Rodriguez managed in the 1960s and 70s, but the latest success was his first in Europe and at one of the sport's historic circuits.
Perez's previous two wins were in Azerbaijan, with Red Bull last year, and in Bahrain in 2020 with Aston Martin's predecessors Racing Point.
The Mexican was also the first Mexican to conquer the streets of Monaco, one of the races every driver yearns to win, and first Latin American driver since Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya in 2003.
""Winning Monaco is a dream come true as a driver,"" he said.
""When you come to Formula One and when you come to Monaco and drive it for the first time you always dream about one day winning the race.
""It's just incredible, such a big day for myself. I was driving with Pedro Rodriguez's helmet today and I'm sure that up there he will be super proud of what we have achieved in this sport.""
Mexico has only ever had six Formula One drivers and Perez and Rodriguez are the sole winners.
Perez started third on the grid, behind the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz, but a strategic masterstroke on the pitstops and a bit of ""tyre whispering"" made the difference.
Nothing can ever be taken for granted in Monaco, where going a few millimetres too wide can spell disaster on the metal-fenced track, but Perez made no mistakes as he was hustled through the closing laps by Sainz.
He had crashed in Saturday qualifying at the end of the session, but Formula One fortunes can change quickly.
""I'm a big fan of my sport,"" said Perez. ""So, certainly knowing what it means to win a race like this. I mean, they're all very important, but certainly this is very special. And it goes very, very high in the list for my country.
""I'm the only Mexican, or even Latin American, driver on the grid,"" he added.
""So, it just shows how difficult it is for us... to make it into the sport and to have a successful career in this sport. It is quite hard, but I have to say I'm extremely proud of it.""

The Mexican was overlooked and underrated then, hoping in vain for a top team to come calling, while the Swede toiled among tail-enders and also-rans.
In five seasons and 97 races with Caterham and Sauber/Alfa Romeo, Ericsson scored 18 points and never finished higher than eighth. 
In three of those seasons, he drew a complete blank.
When Ericsson left for a fresh start in America at the end of 2018, his fame largely rested on being blamed unfairly for Frenchman Romain Grosjean hitting a wall in Azerbaijan.
Grosjean's engineer triggered mirth across social media when he said over the radio, with no other car evidently involved, ""I think Ericsson hit us"". 
Perez in 2018 was fighting for the Force India team's survival, staying on as they came out of administration and morphed into Racing Point under the ownership of Canadian Lawrence Stroll.
By the end of 2020 Perez was surplus to requirement, the team signing four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel for a new start as Aston Martin, and was heading for the exit until he won in Bahrain and Red Bull stepped in.
Their victories in the two great races showed how fortunes can change and why drivers - eternal optimists - never abandon hope.
""They say it is life changing winning this race,"" said Chip Ganassi Racing driver Ericsson. 
""Coming to IndyCar one of my goals was to show what I could do, show my skills because I felt in F1 I didn't get a chance to do that. So I came here.""
He joins a growing list of ex-Formula One drivers who have achieved more by leaving than staying, even if Grosjean again hit the wall at Indianapolis.
Japan's Takuma Sato had one podium in 90 F1 starts before winning Indy in 2017 and 2020. American Alexander Rossi started  five races with struggling Marussia before winning Indy in 2016.
Perez, who had to wait 190 races for his first grand prix success and 215 until his first pole, will not be joining them when the time comes to leave F1.
""I think once I am done with F1, I need to go back and look after my kids. I already have three. So yeah, I'll be quite busy,"" he said.

The night session, for which Amazon Prime has exclusive broadcasting rights in France, starts at 9pm local time and was introduced for the first time at the 2021 edition of the claycourt major.
""I don't like night sessions on clay. I am very clear with that,"" Nadal, who enjoys a near mythical status at Roland Garros, where he has a statue erected in his honour, told reporters last week.
""I don't like to play on clay during the night because humidity is higher, the ball is slower and there can be very heavy conditions especially when it's cold.
""I think that makes a big difference on the way you play tennis on clay during the night and during the day.""
Teen sensation Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev have both said they would not want their quarter-final, also on Tuesday, to be scheduled during the night session.
The match between the Spaniard and the German third seed was put as the third one on Court Philippe Chatrier.
The Djokovic-Nadal rivalry is such a hot bill that usual rules tend not to apply when the two heavyweights face each other at the French Open.
Last year, the COVID-19 curfew was pushed back to allow fans to stay longer at Roland Garros when Djokovic knocked Nadal out in the semi-finals and this year, the match will be broadcast for free on Prime Video, organisers said.
Asked about his choice during a TV interview Djokovic said with a smile: ""I can only say that Rafa and I would make different applications.""
""As top players, we do have requests, but those requests are not always accepted,"" he told reporters.
""The tournament director, along with TV, broadcasters, I think in the end of the day that's who decides ... TV, whether they want your match, day or night.
""You just have to adjust to that. Obviously, depending on who you play, sometimes it's favourable to play night; sometimes day. There is no standard or no formula that works always.""","['47_0', '47_1']","[""\n      FILE PHOTO: Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - May 29, 2022 Serbia's Novak Djokovic celebrates winning his fourth round match against Argentina's Diego Schwartzman REUTERS/Yves Herman\n    "", ""\n      FILE PHOTO: Tennis - Rafael Nadal Press Conference - Rafa Nadal Academy, Mallorca, Spain - February 2, 2022 Spain's Rafael Nadal poses with the Australian Open trophy during the press conference REUTERS/Enrique Calvo\n    ""]"
46,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/alonso-still-feeling-effects-australia-crash-2718396,Alonso still feeling effects of Australia crash,"    Twice Formula One world champion Fernando Alonso said he was still feeling the effects of a qualifying crash in Australia last month and expected to suffer for months to come.
The Alpine driver had bandages on both wrists after Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix and told reporters they were a consequence of his Melbourne accident.
""It's still from Australia,"" he said, referring to a crash into the wall at Albert Park.
""Bones, ligaments, tendons, everything is a mess at the moment.
""I need two or three months and there is no surgery, nothing you can do. Just rest. Unfortunately, every two weeks I have to drive so I try to rest at home but it will take a few months,"" added the 40-year-old.
Formula One has six more races scheduled, divided into pairs of double-headers, before the August break.
When it was jokingly suggested that Alonso could hand his car to the Renault-owned team's Australian reserve driver Oscar Piastri, the Spaniard replied: ""Yes, but we need the points.""
Alpine are sixth in the constructors' championship but only a point behind Alfa Romeo and 19 adrift of McLaren after seven races with the top three - Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes - way ahead.
Alonso finished seventh in Monaco, ahead of Mercedes' seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton who was unable to find a way past on the narrow street circuit despite having a faster car and the Spaniard lapping well off the pace.
Alonso said his strategy in the final stint had been to manage the tyres for 15 laps before then pushing for the remaining 15 to the finish.
""It was Hamilton's problem,"" he said. ""This is Monaco and I love to keep people behind.""

Championship leader Verstappen's deal runs to the end of 2028 after the Dutch driver signed a five-year extension in March.
Perez, 32, triumphed on the streets of Monaco on Sunday, becoming the most successful Mexican Formula One driver of all time and also his country's first winner of the showcase race.
He took his first F1 pole position in Saudi Arabia in March and has had four podium finishes in seven races so far this year.
""For us, holding onto his pace, race craft and experience was a no-brainer and we are delighted that Checo will continue to race for the team until 2024,"" said team boss Christian Horner in a statement. 
Verstappen had already hinted on Sunday at the Mexican getting a new deal. ""I think what you did today might help. Just a little bit,"" he said after the race.
That win was the third of Perez's F1 career, and second since he joined Red Bull for the 2021 season, and Horner said the Mexican had done a 'fantastic job'.
""Time and again he has proved himself to not only be a magnificent team player but as his level of comfort has grown he has become a real force to be reckoned with at the sharp end of the grid,"" said the Briton.
""This year he has taken another step and the gap to world champion Max has closed significantly.""
Perez, third overall and 15 points behind Verstappen, came close to being out of a job in 2020 before Red Bull threw him a lifeline.
""This has been an incredible week,"" he said.
""I am so proud to be a member of this team and I feel completely at home here now. We are working very well together and my relationship with Max, on and off the track, is definitely helping drive us forward even more.""

44,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/aston-martins-krack-still-smiling-after-bumpy-start-2721741,Aston Martin's Krack still smiling after bumpy start,"LONDON :     New Aston Martin team boss Mike Krack has had a bumpy start to the season, like those Formula One drivers struggling to tame their bouncing cars in a time of change, but he is still smiling.
The 50-year-old Luxemburger replaced Otmar Szafnauer, now principal of Renault-owned Alpine, at the Silverstone-based team last January in something of a surprise appointment.
""I was not expecting it to be easy,"" he told Reuters in Monaco at the weekend. ""It’s a rough environment, you must not be naive.
""But I’m fine, I’m still laughing so it’s OK.""
Four times world champion Sebastian Vettel was ruled out of the first two races in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia due to COVID-19, with fellow-German Nico Hulkenberg standing in, and he then crashed on Saturday and Sunday in Australia.
After three races, Aston Martin were the only team yet to score a point.
Then in Spain they were caught in controversy, rolling out a new-look car that closely resembled Red Bull's race-winning one although the governing FIA gave it the all-clear.
Red Bull, who have lost some top technical staff to Aston Martin, vowed to search for data leaks but Krack declared the matter closed.
""I do not expect anything more, to be honest. I think we will concentrate on ourselves,"" he said. ""I think their investigations will not lead to anything and I think they will have the championship battle to concentrate on.""
""We are not really concerned because we haven’t done anything wrong.""
Eddie Jordan, founder of the original Silverstone-based team that has morphed through many identities into Aston Martin, was greeted at his first team bosses meeting with 'Welcome to the Piranha Club'.
The sport has put on a show of unity in recent years, teams seemingly pulling together for the common good, but Krack detected a whiff of that original spirit.
""That’s one of the reflections that I was also having,"" he said when asked whether rivals maybe saw Aston Martin, whose owner Lawrence Stroll is father of driver Lance and a billionaire with deep pockets, as a threat.
""If they speak about you, you are alive and you are there and it means that there is a reason behind the accusations or attacks. I take it as a compliment.""
Aston Martin are only ninth after seven races but Krack had no doubt the revised car would change that.
""We have not even had a third of the season. We can still be world champions mathematically,"" he joked. ""We don’t give up. The season is far from being a write-off.
""We have good people, we have made a first step with the concept change and it shows how well the team can analyse and react; it’s not too proud to change direction,"" he added. ""I would be surprised if we finished the season where we are now.""

The vote by 89-1 ended a heated two-year negotiation that pitted rugby bosses against the players' association and provincial rugby unions, amid concern about selling off part of the country's culture to foreign owners.
Rugby is more than just a game in New Zealand and is seen as an integral part of the social fabric.
The All Blacks are regarded as national heroes, winning three of the nine Rugby World Cups, and are one of the most successful teams in world sport.
NZR chairman Stewart Mitchell hailed a ""monumental moment in the history of rugby in New Zealand"".
""It has taken us some time to reach this point and that is because our members care so deeply about our game, our communities, and our people,"" he said Thursday.
Right up until the vote, closed-door meetings were going on as New Zealand's 26 provincial unions sought assurances they would not be sidelined and there would be benefits for the game at the grassroots level.
The deal sees Silver Lake, a fund manager specialising in private equity investments and whose growing stable of sports interests already includes Manchester City, pay NZ$200 million for a 5.8 per cent stake in a new commercial entity operated by NZR.
An additional investment of NZ$100 million will later be offered to New Zealand-based institutional investors and Silver Lake's holding could rise to 8.58 percent depending on the share uptake.
Silver Lake is expected to provide expertise in areas such as broadcast, sponsorship and digital technology innovations.
""Digital technologies are changing sports and media, providing a lot of opportunities for rugby, and we are ready to help go after them while respecting the values and traditions of the game in New Zealand,"" said Silver Lake managing director Stephen Evans.
Critics say the All Blacks have not capitalised on their marketability in a way other leading brands in sports such as Formula One and European and English football have done.
New Zealand Rugby was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, losing NZ$40 million in 2020, and its provinces have been losing money for several years as spectator and player numbers fall.
NZR chief executive Mark Robinson believes if money floods in under the Silver Lake deal it could enable a new pay structure with the players and provinces.
Rugby Players' Association chief executive Rob Nichol described the lengthy negotiations as ""a thorough and robust process"" with ""the potential to be a very successful partnership and way forward for rugby in New Zealand"".
Robinson said it would enable NZR to take the All Blacks to a wider audience, but cautioned that ""it is in no way a magic bullet.
""We know there is still a lot of hard work to do and we know the Silver Lake team hold the same view.""
Sport has become an attractive proposition for institutional investors in recent years, particularly in the United States and Europe, and rugby has not been immune.
Private equity company CVC last year paid £365 million for a 14.3 per cent stake in the Six Nations.
New Zealand Rugby's Mitchell also warned that the deal was not an instant cure.
""We've now got to sit down, work with a new board, make sure we get these business plans in place, make sure we perform to those business plans with our partners and reap the rewards that hopefully will come in the next four to five years,"" he said.",['43_0'],['\nThe All Blacks are regarded as national heroes in New Zealand and are one of the most successful teams in world sport (Photo: AFP/File/JUAN MABROMATA)\n']

The victory was a third of the season for New Zealander Evans of Jaguar TCS Racing, who finished ahead of DS Techeetah's pole-sitter Jean-Eric Vergne and Venturi's Edoardo Mortara.
Vandoorne, fifth, now has a five point lead over Frenchman Vergne with Swiss racer Mortara two more points behind and Evans 12 adrift of the Belgian in a tight battle at the top with seven races remaining.
Temperature management was a big factor in the Indonesian heat as Jakarta made its debut as one of two new venues this season.
""That was a hot, hard race,"" said Evans, who started in third place and overtook Vergne for the lead in the final minutes at the Ancol Beach Resort track. ""I was just happy to be in it at the end. 
""We needed a good result today...it was a new track, new climate, new everything and you don't really know how it is going to go.""
Vergne finished 0.733 of a second behind Evans with Mortara a further 0.967 adrift.

Speaking to CNN on Thursday ahead of this weekend's inaugural Miami Grand Prix, the Monegasque driver said he expected Ferrari and Red Bull to provide a four-way tussle for the drivers' title and be the main protagonists in the teams' title race.
But, as he made clear with a smile, he would not allow the battle for glory to spoil his enjoyment of what has, so far, been the happiest season of his career.
""I love my job, I love driving, this was what I always dreamt to do,"" he said. ""And now I am in Formula One with the best team in the world, in my opinion, Ferrari - and fighting for wins. So, life is great.
""I am definitely going to the track with a big smile on my face because I am obviously in a much happier place than last year. Going to the track, knowing you have the opportunity to win ... it feels amazing.""
Asked about fallen champions Mercedes, who have struggled with their car under the new regulations introduced this year, he said they would recover.
""I am pretty sure they will win races at some time this season,"" he said. ""I never write them off because they are such a strong team and they have shown it in the past.
""But it is true that they are struggling and have since the beginning of this season - they seem to have ... issues that require a bit of time before they fix them.
""So, maybe not for the championship this year.""
Leclerc leads the drivers' championship with 86 points ahead of defending champion Max Verstappen on 59 and his Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez on 54.
Mercedes' George Russell is fourth on 49 ahead of Carlos Sainz, in the second Ferrari, while his team-mate, seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton, is down in seventh on 28 points.
In the constructors' championship, Mercedes - who last year reeled off an unprecedented eighth consecutive triumph - are third on 77 behind Ferrari on 124 and Red Bull on 113.
Leclerc said he did not see the drivers' championship as a straight battle between him and Verstappen.
""No, because Checo (Perez) is extremely close,"" he said. ""Carlos has been a bit unlucky and maybe now he is getting there too, but I think it will be between us four.""
He added that he felt more secure in his position as leader this year than he had in the past.
""In 2019, every time I found myself in the lead, to be completely honest I don't think I was completely in control of the situation,"" he said.
""Obviously (there were) a lot of emotions. I was leading the first laps of my career, something I had dreamt of doing since I was child - and being a Ferrari driver in the first year ...
""This year everything is a lot more controlled. I know why we are here. I know everything we have done to arrive at this point of fighting for the championship. I know what to do to win races.""",['41_0'],"[""\nCharles Leclerc (R) does not think that Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes can fight for the constructors' title (Photo: AFP/File/Giuseppe CACACE)\n""]"

Richardson was selected ahead of namesake Jhye Richardson to replace rested Pat Cummins and join Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood in the attack in Colombo.
Captain Aaron Finch said selectors had considered picking second spinner Mitchell Swepson to partner Ashton Agar but went with pace after seeing the pitch.
""It's not a dry surface by any stretch,"" Finch told reporters on Monday. ""There hasn't been a huge amount of cricket here, and with it being the wet season the wickets are under covers a lot more.""
All-rounders Mitchell Marsh and Glenn Maxwell, along with batsmen David Warner and Steve Smith, have been recalled after missing home matches against Sri Lanka in February and a one-off match against Pakistan in April.
Smith's place in the team is under scrutiny, with classy wicketkeeper-batsman Josh Inglis waiting in the wings.
Finch backed Smith to continue his floating role as a ""Mr Fix-it"" in the order while conceding that Inglis was unlucky to miss out.
""He'll definitely get an opportunity,"" Finch said of Inglis, citing the quick turnaround between the three T20s and then the five one-day internationals.
Australia, who will defend their T20 World Cup title on home soil in four months, start the series without head coach Andrew McDonald on site after his positive test for COVID-19.
However, Finch said he has had plenty of contact with McDonald.
""A lot of that (coaching) is done pre-tour,"" said Finch.
""But I have spoken to him a lot about how we're going to structure the team and how we want it to look over the next couple of months leading into that World Cup.""

It said an 'accepted breach agreement' dated May 19, 2022 was entered into by the FIA and Williams Grand Prix Engineering Limited.
Williams were notified on Apr 12 that they had committed a procedural breach after the team voluntarily disclosed the problem ahead of the Mar 31 full year reporting deadline.
The matter has since been resolved and Williams have paid the penalty.
The former champions are the first to be punished for a breach of the cost cap regulations which limit Formula One teams to spending of US$140 million this year.
Privately-owned Williams, once dominant but without a title since 1997 and now fighting among the back-markers, have one of the smaller budgets in the sport.
The biggest and wealthiest teams have warned that keeping within the limits will be impossible due to inflation and spiralling costs, and want the FIA to stretch the cap.

The championship, which started in 1950, has had only male drivers on the starting grid since 1976 but has made a push for diversity and inclusion with teams showing support for the LGBTQ community.
Aston Martin driver Vettel last year wore a rainbow-coloured T shirt in Hungary with the message 'same love' to protest anti-LGBTQ+ legislation.
The 34-year-old father of three has also competed with Racing Pride logos on his car.
""Perhaps it wouldn’t have been the case in the past, but now I think a gay Formula One driver would be welcomed, and rightly so,"" Vettel said in an interview with LGBTQ magazine Attitude that featured him on its cover.
""I feel that a gay driver would help to speed up the elimination of prejudice and help push our sport in a better direction. So I think and hope our sport would be ready for one.""
The former Red Bull and Ferrari driver said he had noticed attitudes changing, with some engineers and mechanics able to be more open.
Formula One champions Mercedes announced on Wednesday they will be racing with a rainbow star on their cars for the three grands prix in June, Pride Month, as a gesture of public support.
Seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton and team mate George Russell will also have the 'Pride Star' on their helmets in Azerbaijan, Canada and Britain.
Vettel compared the situation to professional soccer and ""the old image of a player or driver as a ‘hero’ who should match a certain set of criteria.
""But the judging criteria are just wrong. How are those stereotypes in any way related to performance? Who got to decide?,"" he asked.

The Dutchman was heading for victory at the Baku street track last year when a tyre exploded and pitched him into the barrier on the high speed run along the city’s Caspian Sea waterfront.
Mexican team mate Sergio Perez took the win instead and returns triumphant and as a potential title contender after his victory two weeks ago in Monaco.
Verstappen will be determined to stop him becoming the first driver to win twice in Baku.
""I’m looking forward to returning to Baku, we have some unfinished business there after last year,"" said the 24-year-old who has a nine point lead over Ferrari rival Charles Leclerc with Perez a further six behind.
""Last year was unlucky, simple as that,"" he said.
""It was a very painful one, but that happens. That’s racing ... it’s different cars, different tyres (this time) and we go again.""
Perez, who was also on the podium in Baku twice while racing for Force India, is in the form of his life and with a new two-year contract with Red Bull freshly signed.
The 6km long Baku street track, a mix of flat-out blasts and tight corners lined by unforgiving barriers, is famed for unpredictable races and has produced five different winners in five years on the calendar.
Leclerc is familiar with the track's pitfalls, having crashed while on course for pole position in 2019.
The Monegasque and Ferrari, chasing a first title since 2008, will want the weekend to go perfectly after potential wins slipped through their fingers in Monaco and Spain.
Seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton will also be keen to make amends after failing to capitalise on Verstappen's retirement last year when he went from second to 15th in Baku, having accidentally triggered a 'brake magic' function on his steering wheel.
His Mercedes team are the most successful in Baku, with three wins. A fourth looks a distant prospect unless the track throws up another surprise.
""Baku often produces some fun and crazy track action, and the layout generates good racing opportunities,"" said Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff.
""So, let’s see if it lives up to its reputation this weekend.""
The possibility of podium appearance by a midfield team is always there. Apart from Perez's Force India exploits, Sebastian Vettel was second last year for Aston Martin with Pierre Gasly third for AlphaTauri.

The ATP said its strategic plan for widespread reform has received the green light, in a move that is likely to end the bitter wrangling over prize money and profit-sharing in men's tennis.
This first phase of the ATP's OneVision plan - primarily aimed at boosting revenue from media and television rights - was approved by its board after more than two years of deliberations.
""Shifting everybody's mind into the future has been the most difficult part,"" ATP Chairman Andrea Gaudenzi told Reuters.
""But I think overall we kept being very persistent, the evidence we provided, a lot of data, a lot of information, a lot of material and ultimately we convinced, I wouldn't say everybody, but the majority.""
A lack of transparency has long been a cause of friction between tournaments and players, and the issue flared again when the coronavirus pandemic forced cuts in prize money.
But starting next year players will have access to the audited financial statements of events, the 50-50 profit sharing formula will be implemented and there will be increased prize money and bonus pools due to the expansion of ATP 1000 events.
Italian Gaudenzi, a former top-20 singles player, says the sport overly relies on ticket sales and needs structural change.
He was ""happy and proud"" finally to get the board's backing after the pandemic forced all sporting bodies into crisis mode.
""It's a little bit like trying to engage employees in a startup,"" the 48-year-old said in a video interview. ""You give them stock options, you give them a share of the upside and success. That's where you create the motivation and the drive. And that's where you create alignment.""
Masters tournaments in Indian Wells and Miami already take place as 12-day events with bigger draw sizes. Starting in 2023, the ATP Masters events in Madrid, Rome and Shanghai will also follow suit.
From 2025, the Canada and Cincinnati events will also transform to 12 days.
The four Grand Slams - the biggest events on the tennis calendar and run independently outside the ATP or the women's WTA - are played over two weeks, or 15 days for the French Open.
""It does help tennis in general if the gap between Slams and Masters becomes a little bit smaller because you want to have the continuity of the narrative,"" Gaudenzi said.
""That's a huge value, especially nowadays that players like Apple, Amazon, Netflix... when they roll out the product, they roll it out in 180 markets not in one. What's better than tennis? It's 24/7, every day of the year, gender neutral, both men and women.""
Prize money at the five expanded tournaments will jump by more than 35 per cent between 2022 and 2025, the ATP says. The year-end bonus pool is projected almost to double in the near term and will be distributed between the top-30 players instead of the top-12 previously.
A new profit sharing mechanism could stand to benefit more than 140 players, based on the financial performance of tournaments.
Enjoying a massive worldwide following, tennis is governed by seven different organisations: ATP, WTA, the four Grand Slams and the International Tennis Federation.
The second phase of 'OneVision' aims at creating a unified governance structure and operating model for the sport.
Gaudenzi admits it will not be easy.
""Let's say without phase one, phase two made no sense,"" he added. ""Sometimes it's more difficult to get the engine started. Once you get the engine started, you're always gonna have a few bumps in the road.""
The marketing departments of the ATP and WTA were aligned at the start of 2021 and Gaudenzi feels the ""natural first step"" of the second phase will be for the men's and women's bodies to further collaborate.

""Some of the grandstands are already sold out, some of the grandstands are very close to their capacity.
""So we are looking to be sold out this weekend for sure.""
Azerbaijan a former member of the Soviet Union which borders Russia, joined the Formula One calendar in 2016 with a race around the streets of its capital Baku.
The event, which has acquired a reputation for serving up unpredictable thrillers with no driver having won more than once, was absent from the calendar in 2020 and ran behind closed doors last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The race, whose contract keeps it on the calendar until 2024, has proven to be popular with Russian fans, said Rahimov.
""We are missing out on the Russian fans due to the difficulties,"" he said, adding fans flying in from Europe were also finding travel to Azerbaijan tricky with Moscow no longer a viable transit hub.
""But on a good note ... we are at between 25 and 30 per cent international spectators this year as it looks from the current numbers and this is more than the 22 per cent that we had in 2019.
""So if we had the full Russian spectator group that we used to have in the previous years I think we would beat all the records this year.""
Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine on Feb 24, calling it a ""special operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" its neighbour.
Formula One terminated its contract with the promoter of the Russian Grand Prix, which joined the calendar in 2014 with a race around the Sochi Olympic Park, in the wake of the country's actions.
""Unfortunately, it is what it is,"" said Rahimov.
""But even with the current difficulties, we are still performing much better on the international spectator side which is very pleasing for us.""","['35_0', '35_1']","['\n      Formula One F1 - Azerbaijan Grand Prix - Baku City Circuit, Baku, Azerbaijan - June 9, 2022 General view ahead of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix REUTERS/Murad Sezer\n    ', '\n      Formula One F1 - Azerbaijan Grand Prix - Baku City Circuit, Baku, Azerbaijan - June 9, 2022 Fans pose on the track with the flag of Ukraine ahead of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix REUTERS/Murad Sezer\n    ']"

Pierson will be 16 years and 118 days old when the race starts at the Circuit de la Sarthe in north-west France, 84 days younger than his compatriot Matt McMurry was when he set the record in 2014.
""It’s nice to come in to such an historic event and know that no matter what happens I’ll be a part of that history,"" the Oregon native told Reuters ahead of the 90th edition of a race first held in May 1923.
""But in general it’s not the big thing on my mind. 
""I’m here to be the best driver I can be and that’s my job. That’s my main focus. I’m not really worried about anything else.""
Pierson is racing in the second tier LMP2 category for the United Autosports team co-founded and co-owned by McLaren Formula One boss Zak Brown.
His team mates in the #23 Oreca 07-Gibson car are Britons Oliver Jarvis, who won this year's 24 Hours of Daytona and Le Mans LMP2 in 2017, and Formula E race winner Alex Lynn.
Pierson is already the youngest winner in the World Endurance Championship, taking LMP2 victory with Jarvis and former F1 driver Paul di Resta in the 1,000 miles of Sebring last March.
""I think it definitely showed my strengths, showed that I’m here to win and compete like everyone else and it’s not just because of this or that that I made it,"" he said.
The American started karting as a two-year-old but does not come from a motorsport background, other than his father doing some club racing and the family following various series as fans.
He said it was never something he felt pushed into.
""I’ve very much focused on myself and what I was doing and if someone was saying maybe it's too early or too soon, well that’s kind of expected,"" he added.
""I’m very sure of myself and I don’t think I would have made it here if I didn’t make the right decisions and someone didn’t think I was good enough.""
Pierson was keeping an open mind on his future, and whether the road ahead leads to endurance racing or IndyCar and Formula One - two series he follows avidly and would love to have a shot at.
In the meantime, there is the challenge of speeding down the Mulsanne straight in the dark, and possibly also in the wet with the headlights bouncing off the rain and spray.
""Night is nothing new and throughout my career I’ve had plenty of rain racing,"" he said. ""I’m ready for whatever comes at us.""

33,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/hamilton-gets-honorary-brazilian-citizenship-2738191,Hamilton gets honorary Brazilian citizenship,"SAO PAULO: Formula One's seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton was made an honorary citizen of Brazil on Thursday as the lower house of parliament passed a bill on the matter.
The move had been proposed by congressman Andre Figueiredo after last year's Brazilian Grand Prix, at which the British driver unfurled the Brazilian flag after winning at Sao Paulo's Interlagos circuit.
Hamilton himself backed the move in April, when he visited Sao Paulo to deliver a keynote speech at an event focused on business and digital transformation, saying he would be honoured.
The house will now hold a solemn session to deliver the 37-year-old the honorary citizenship. A date is yet to be set.
Figueiredo, a member of Brazil's Democratic Labour Party, praised the Mercedes driver for celebrating the country at last year's race and noted that he has always held up the late Brazilian triple world champion Ayrton Senna as his boyhood idol.
Hamilton, knighted by his own country, had his name chanted along with that of Senna, a local hero, as he carried Brazil's flag on to the podium last year.
Congressman Jhonatan de Jesus of the Republicans party said in a report that Hamilton has a ""deep and strongly emotional"" relationship with Brazil and the tribute was well-deserved.
""His gestures add to his indisputable sporting merit. His public positions in support of relevant issues such as the environment, animal rights, Black people, women and human rights must also be remembered and highlighted,"" Jesus said.
The Congress vote was largely symbolic as the debate lasted for about 10 minutes. Some members of Congress, however, met the bill with criticism.
""I recognize Lewis Hamilton's achievements ... but this bill makes clear that we are not addressing Brazil's structural problems as a priority,"" Tiago Mitraud of the New Party said.",['33_0'],"[""\nFILE PHOTO: Formula One F1 - Azerbaijan Grand Prix - Baku City Circuit, Baku, Azerbaijan - June 9, 2022 Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton ahead of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger\n""]"

The 32-year-old moved to McLaren from Renault last season with his contract running until the end of 2023.
But his struggles to get to grips with the Woking-based team's car have continued into a second season, raising questions about whether he will see out the length of his deal.
The speculation intensified after Brown confirmed the existence of exit clauses in Ricciardo's contract two weeks ago at the Indy 500, on the same weekend as the Monaco Grand Prix, while announcing that McLaren's IndyCar team had extended their agreement with F1 aspirant Pato O'Ward.
""Yeah, so, firstly we've spoken, we've had a catch up,"" Ricciardo told reporters at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.
""The clarity is clear for us moving forward, my contract is clear with the team until the end of next year, I'm fully committed.
""I have the full support of the team and we want to do it together,"" he added.
Ricciardo, an eight-time grand prix winner who handed McLaren their first victory since the Brazilian Grand Prix in 2012 at Italy's Monza last year, has scored points just twice this season, one of which was in Saturday's 'Sprint' race in Imola.
Team mate Lando Norris, who beat Ricciardo last season and was given a new contract this season stretching to the end of 2025, has scored a podium and six points finishes, including the Imola 'Sprint', from seven races so far. 
Ricciardo, who twice finished third in the overall drivers' standings while racing for Red Bull, said he hadn't read too much into Brown's comments adding his self-belief was intact.
""I think stripping it back to the core, I still know what I can do, I still believe I have it,"" he said.
""It's not a place of like low self-confidence or low self-esteem... I think in this sport that everything operates at such a high level and if something's a little bit out of tune it can have a carry on effect.
""So it's really just for me to get back in that place where I'm fully in tune with the car and then it'll come.""",['32_0'],"[""\nFormula One F1 - Azerbaijan Grand Prix - Baku City Circuit, Baku, Azerbaijan - June 10, 2022 McLaren's Daniel Ricciardo during a press conference REUTERS/Murad Sezer\n""]"

The Mexican, who headed into the weekend with his sights set on following up his Monaco victory by becoming the first repeat winner at the Baku city track, lapped the six-km, barrier-lined layout in one minute 43.170 seconds.   
That was good enough to eclipse Leclerc, who is looking to bounce back from the double disappointment of losing out on victory in Spain and Monaco, by 0.070 seconds.
The pair have traded places at the top of the practice timesheets all weekend, with Perez fastest in Friday's opening session and Leclerc taking over in practice two.
World championship leader Max Verstappen, who is nine points ahead of Leclerc and 15 ahead of Perez in the overall standings, had to abort his final flying lap and settle for third nearly 0.3 seconds off the pace.  
Spaniard Carlos Sainz was fourth for Ferrari ahead of McLaren team mates Lando Norris and Daniel Ricciardo.
Pierre Gasly was seventh for AlphaTauri ahead of Mercedes driver George Russell and Esteban Ocon's Alpine. 
Aston Martin's four-times champion Sebastian Vettel rounded out the top 10.
Lewis Hamilton, who changed the set-up on his Mercedes during the session, was only 12th. The Briton was informed by his race engineer that his engine had been turned down.
The final practice session got underway 15 minutes late after a crash in the preceding Formula Two race damaged some barriers.
Qualifying will therefore also start with a 15-minute delay later on Saturday.

Rao, who served as the FIA's legal director from mid-2016 to the end of 2018 before joining Mercedes as the team's general counsel and then special advisor to Wolff, was named as the interim replacement for the departed Peter Bayer.
Austrian Bayer, who led the investigation into the controversial title-deciding safety car restart at last year's season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, had served as the FIA's F1 executive director since last year and secretary general for sport since 2017.  
""Certainly it’s a concern,"" Binotto told reporters at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.
""She is a great person, she’s got a lot of experience, she will certainly be capable of doing the job.
""It’s down to them to make sure that there will be no conflicts of interest at all, to behave properly and it’s down to the president to ensure it,"" he added.
Former rally driver Mohammed Ben Sulayem was elected as the FIA's first non-European president in December.
He has carried out changes to F1's refereeing procedure in the wake of the Abu Dhabi controversy, appointing Niels Wittich and Eduardo Freitas to replace Michael Masi in the role of race director.
There was no explanation for Bayer's departure and no indication that Rao's appointment was in any way related to events in Abu Dhabi.
Sitting alongside Binotto, Wolff gave Rao his vote of confidence.
""What the positive is about having Shaila-Ann in this position is she’s one about governance and transparency.
""She’s a lawyer and I think this is something we have always criticised in the past that things weren’t always as transparent and as clear for the teams.

The Monegasque lit up the timing screens with a one minute, 41.359 second lap, beating Red Bull's Sergio Perez by a handy 0.282 seconds.
His championship rival Max Verstappen, who holds a nine-point advantage over Leclerc in the overall standings, was third 0.347 seconds adrift, while Carlos Sainz in the other Ferrari was fourth.
Leclerc's performance on Saturday earned him his sixth pole from eight races so far this season, and fourth in a row.
It made the 24-year-old the first driver to take a repeat pole around the Baku street track, having also started last year's Azerbaijan race from the front. If he converts it on Sunday, it would make him the race's first multiple winner.
""This one I didn't expect and I thought Red Bull were stronger,"" said Leclerc, who now has 15 career poles.
""In the last lap everything came together.""

The phenomenon, in which the cars bounce dramatically at high speeds as aerodynamic grip is gained then lost, like the motion of a porpoise through water, has resulted from a radical rules overhaul introduced this year. 
That overhaul has seen the cars generate a significant chunk of their grip from the underside of the floor. 
""I think it’s just a matter of time before we see a major incident,"" Russell told reporters after qualifying fifth for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. 
""A lot of us can barely keep the car in a straight line over these bumps, we’re going around the last two corners at 300 kilometres per hour, bottoming out, you can visibly see on the tarmac, how close the cars are running into the ground.""
""With the technology we have in today’s environment, it seems unnecessary we’re running an F1 car at 200 miles an hour millimetres from the ground and it’s a recipe for disaster.
""I don’t really know what the future holds but I don’t think we can sustain this for three years or however long these regulations are in force for,"" Russell added.
Teams have been affected to varying degrees by the bouncing and have had to run their cars at a higher ride height to mitigate it which has compromised performance.    
Russell's formerly dominant Mercedes team has struggled with the problem all year. 
Ferrari have also been among those most affected but it has not stopped them being in the fight at the front.
Team bosses said they needed to understand why some outfits were affected to a greater degree, adding a solution would be found with time.
""I'm pretty sure we will find a solution, medium-long term,"" Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto told reporters earlier on Saturday. 
""So, I think we need to accept it. 
""It's certainly something on which we need all to better understand to improve.""

The Monegasque, who had started from pole for the sixth time in eight races and fourth in a row, pulled into the pits with a smoking engine at the end of the 20th lap.
Ferrari confirmed the power unit was the problem.
Leclerc had lost out at the start to Red Bull's Sergio Perez but regained the lead through the pitstops.
It was Leclerc's second retirement from three races and came after Spanish team mate Carlos Sainz pulled off the track with a hydraulic failure on lap 10 in his third retirement of the campaign.
Ferrari's double failure handed the lead to Red Bull's world champion Max Verstappen, who went into the race with a nine-point lead over Leclerc. Perez was running second.
""It hurts, we really need to look into that for it to not  happen again. I don't really find the right words to describe this,"" Leclerc told Sky Sports television.
""It's very, very disappointing. We've been fast and we didn't have particularly big problems in the first part of the season. Now it seems that we have a bit more compared to the beginning but we didn't change massive things,"" he added.
""It's difficult to understand for now but we will have to analyse.""
Leclerc could not say how the failure might affect his engine allocation for the rest of the season, with grid penalties for exceeding the number permitted.

The Dutchman eased across the line 20.8 seconds clear of Sergio Perez who, ordered not to fight Verstappen, completed a one-two for Red Bull.
George Russell kept his record of finishing every race this season in the top five with third for Mercedes.  
Ferrari's miserable afternoon ended after 20 of the race's 51 laps.
Charles Leclerc, who is leading the team's challenge and had started from pole, pulled into the pits from the lead with his Ferrari spewing smoke to chalk up his second retirement from three races.
His team mate Carlos Sainz had pulled to the side of the track 10 laps earlier with a hydraulic failure.
""Today we had incredible pace in the car, we could look after the tyres and chip away at it,"" said Verstappen, all too familiar with the heartbreak of retiring from the lead, having crashed out while running first in Baku last year.
""A tiny bit lucky with the retirement but the car was quick today.""
The win was Verstappen's fifth from eight races this year and made him the sixth different Baku winner from six races.
He extended his overall championship lead to 21 points over Perez, winner in Monaco two weeks ago, who has moved up to second.
Leclerc, who has won two races this year but none since the third of the season in Australia, slipped to third, 34 points adrift of his Dutch rival.
""It hurts, we need to look into it so it doesn't happen again,"" said Leclerc who left Australia with a 46-point lead over Verstappen.
Leclerc had gone into Sunday's race determined to make good on his fourth successive pole after being unable to convert top spot into victory at the last three races.
But he was on the back foot from the off, losing the lead to second-placed starter Perez into the first corner.
He did not appear to have the pace to match Perez and was instead busy fending off Verstappen.
But an opportunistic pitstop under a virtual safety car period, triggered by Sainz's failure, allowed him to jump back into first until his car's demise eventually dashed his hopes.
Verstappen, meanwhile, had moved past Perez, who was bidding to become the Baku race's first repeat winner. Red Bull instructed the Mexican not to resist and the Dutchman inherited the lead when Leclerc retired.
""In this place anything can happen ... we managed to get a one-two, so that's a great team result,"" said Perez who took the point for fastest lap.
Seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton finished fourth but was nursing an aching back, the result of the porpoising, or bouncing, plaguing his Mercedes.
Kevin Magnussen triggered another safety car when his Haas ground to a halt. China's Guanyu Zhou also retired his Alfa Romeo with a technical issue. Both teams use Ferrari power units.

Swiss driver Sebastien Buemi, now a four-times winner of the world's greatest endurance race, and Japanese first timer Ryo Hirakawa shared the overall victory in the number eight GR010 hybrid hypercar.
The number seven Toyota, crewed by last year's winners Mike Conway of Britain, Japan's Kamui Kobayashi and Argentina's Jose Maria Lopez, secured the predictable one-two finish at the Sarthe circuit.
Glickenhaus Racing's number 709 car completed the podium with Britain's Richard Westbrook, French driver Franck Mailleux and American Ryan Briscoe but they were in a different league to Toyota who had no real rivals.
Hartley won Le Mans in 2017 with Porsche and in 2020 with Toyota when he took the place of Spain's two times Formula One world champion and double Le Mans winner Fernando Alonso.
Buemi has taken all four of his wins with the Japanese manufacturer.
""Unless I change cars I'll never catch him,"" joked the Kiwi, who secured pole position on Thursday.
Toyota were the only major manufacturer in a field of just five hypercars, a situation that will change next year when Peugeot, Ferrari, Porsche and Cadillac step up and provide more competition.
Le Mans has a habit of biting back and choosing its winner, however, and reliability can never be taken for granted as the number seven crew discovered.
The two Toyotas had swapped the lead and were separated by only a few seconds for much of the first 16 hours until technical problems struck.
Lopez slowed at Arnage on lap 256 with the motor generator unit requiring a reset by the side of the track before he could return to the pits for a stop of more than three minutes in what turned out to be the defining moment of the race.
The Argentine then suffered a slow puncture, losing more time.
The number 38 Jota LMP2 car shared by Portugal's Antonio Felix da Costa, Britain's Will Stevens and Mexican Roberto Gonzalez were winners in the second tier.
The race, founded in 1923 and now in its 90th edition, started in sunny conditions and with the 62-strong field cheered on by a crowd of 244,200 freed from recent COVID-19 restrictions.
The drivers include 16-year-old American Josh Pierson, who became both the youngest ever competitor and finisher - 10th overall - with United Autosports in the second tier LMP2 category.

""It happened to me, it happened to many people in the past and unfortunately it's happening to Charles.
""If I would be in the same situation, I would also be disappointed, I think that's very normal, but it's about how you come out of it.""

He is now 21 points ahead of Red Bull team mate Sergio Perez, who completed a one-two behind Verstappen on Sunday, with Leclerc 34 points adrift having dropped to third.
The 24-year-old, who went into the weekend nine points behind Verstappen, has now failed to convert top spot into victory in the last four races in a row for reasons ranging from a lack of reliability to strategic missteps. 
Sunday's failure was the second time in three races that Leclerc had retired from the lead.
It came shortly after team mate Carlos Sainz had also stopped with a hydraulic failure, resulting in a double retirement for Ferrari.
Verstappen has himself been sidelined twice by reliability woes this year and trailed Leclerc by 46 points after the opening three races of the season.

The sight of a seven-time world champion in the prime of his life wincing from back pain and grabbing onto a helping elbow as he gingerly got out of his car at the end of Sunday's race will live long in the memory.
Lewis Hamilton had warned Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff before lights out that there was a danger his car's bouncing, which returned with a vengeance on the streets of Baku, might force him into an early retirement. But drawing on reserves of the professionalism and drive and obstinacy he's called on to overcome any adversity blocking his journey through Formula One he stuck it out to the bitter end. His reward was fourth behind teammate George Russell and the dominant Red Bull duo.
With a dozen more points in the bank he approaches another tricky weekend of street fighting in Montreal with a grand total of 62 to leave him sixth in the Max Verstappen-led drivers' table, with his teammate on 99 in fourth. Wolff apologised to Hamilton over the team radio. ""This is a bit of a box to drive. And sorry for the back problems"". 
Despite Russell last week urging the FIA to rethink the radical new designs for the cars that some teams have done better with than others it's clear F1's so-called ""porpoising"" generation isn't going anywhere fast, a bit like the car Hamilton had so much trouble extricating himself from. ""There are no holy cows, everything is being looked at and we've got a great team trying to solve our issues,"" said Wolff.
Hamilton and Mercedes can at least take comfort from one of the curious aspects of a season now a third of the way through - that his tally of 34 points from the last five races since Australia in a struggling machine is only four fewer than Charles Leclerc has managed at the wheel of a far superior Ferrari.
Leclerc was looking every inch world champion material after Australia. But he has endured a catastrophic time of it since, especially taking into account in four of the last five races he was on pole. With Carlos Sainz also limping out Ferrari once again are putting their heads together to find out what went wrong.
Another member of the grid left Baku in a far happier frame of mind. Pierre Gasly was celebrating an ""incredible"" fifth for his Alpha Tauri team's best result of the season after ""a nice little battle with Lewis"".
AlphaTauri left ""the Land of Fire"" with a bitter-sweet taste though after Yuki Tsunoda was deprived of what looked a likely sixth place finish when he was forced into an unscheduled pitstop after his rear DRS mechanism broke.
""For Yuki the mechanical damage meant we were forced to stop and repair the issue, losing many positions,"" said the team's performance head Guillaume Dezoteux. ""We apologise to him, he did a fantastic job this weekend.""

A Formula One spokesman confirmed Domenicali flew to South Africa after Sunday's Azerbaijan Grand Prix in Baku.
The former Ferrari team boss, who took over at the helm of Formula One last year, will meet representatives of the circuit north of Johannesburg with the sport keen to do a deal.
Africa is the only continent other than Antarctica without a Formula One race and Domenicali, who represents commercial rights holders Liberty Media, has spoken of his desire to rectify that.
Chloe Targett-Adams, Formula One's global director of race promotion, told a CSM-hosted webinar last week that Africa was a big strategic aim.
""It is the only continent we're not in, it's an unbelievable demographic in population and one that we're very keen to bring more into the Formula One world,"" she said. ""So that's very much in our sights.""
South Africa was a regular round of the championship until 1985, when some teams and sponsors boycotted the race due to the country's apartheid system of racial segregation.
The sport returned to Kyalami in 1992 and 1993 after apartheid had ended and Nelson Mandela, later to become the country's first Black head of state, was released from prison.
Mercedes' seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton, the sport's only Black driver, has also pushed for the return of an African race with his father Anthony involved at one point in a Cape Town project.
Financing a race deal has always been the ultimate stumbling block, however.
Talk has intensified recently of Kyalami returning on what would be a record calendar of 24 races next season, if China's race in Shanghai is also re-instated after an absence due to COVID-19.
Formula One has already announced a new race in Las Vegas for 2023, joining US rounds in Miami and Austin, while Qatar starts a new 10-year cycle after dropping off this year's calendar due to the football World Cup.
Some European races, notably France's round at Le Castellet, could miss out.

The 37-year-old Briton's Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff had fuelled concern after telling reporters there was a risk Hamilton might not be in a fit state to compete in Montreal.
Hamilton had spoken of gritting his teeth through the pain in Baku, with the car bouncing down the straights on bumpy asphalt, and called it the toughest race of his career even though he finished fourth.
He posted on Instagram, where he has 28.5 million followers, on Monday to say he felt better.
""Yesterday was tough and had some troubles sleeping but have woke up feeling positive today,"" he said. ""Back is a little sore and bruised but nothing serious thankfully.
""I've had acupuncture and physio with ang (his physiotherapist Angela Cullen) and am on the way to my team to work with them on improving. We have to keep fighting.
""I'll be there this weekend, wouldn't miss it for the world.""
The Canadian Grand Prix, round nine of the championship, will be the country's first since the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of the 2020 and 2021 races.

The current contract for the race at Albert Park was due to expire in 2025 and Sydney had expressed an interest in taking it on.
Melbourne joined the calendar in 1996, taking the place of Adelaide, and Formula 1 will have been there nearly 40 years by the time the latest deal ends.

It is not expected to return to the prime slot taken by Bahrain, although Australian Grand Prix Corporation boss Andrew Westacott told Reuters in April that he wanted the race to be held early in the season.

Britain's seven times world champion suffered severe back pain wrestling with his bouncing car in Baku and said it had been his most painful race.
Team boss Toto Wolff raised some concern about Hamilton being able to race in Canada this weekend but strategy boss James Vowles confirmed in a debrief that the driver would compete in Montreal.
""He is an elite athlete that will push the bounds of endurance of himself and the car and that's what Formula One drivers do, that's what makes them exceptional,"" said Vowles.
""On this occasion though, we pushed the package and our drivers too far, we are putting them into significant discomfort and we simply can't do that again.
""We have a responsibility now to make sure that this doesn't carry on,"" he added, pointing out other drivers were also suffering.""
Hamilton finished fourth in Baku, with Russell third after both Ferrari drivers retired.
Formula One introduced a major rule revamp this season and the changes have caused cars to ""porpoise"" - leaping up and down on the straights as the aerodynamic ground effect is suddenly gained and lost.
Vowles explained that there was a difference between porpoising, bouncing and bottoming.
""I’m confident we’ve made a step forward in terms of porpoising but we very clearly have bouncing and to the outside it looks almost identical, but there is a subtle difference between the two,"" he declared.
Vowles said progress in resolving the porpoising at the Spanish Grand Prix had allowed the team to drop the ride height and run the car lower to the ground - which had revealed another problem.
The car was now ""hitting the deck"" quite hard with the bottoming creating the bouncing evident in Baku.
Vowles said Montreal was not going to be substantially different.
""I think we will still have a package that isn't at the front on merit,"" he said. ""Red Bull and Ferrari will still be the benchmark that we have to compare ourselves to.
""I think, though, that the large gap that you saw in qualifying in Baku perhaps won't be that big in Montreal.""",['19_0'],"[""\nMercedes' Lewis Hamilton on the grid before the race on Jun 12, 2022. (Photo: Reuters/Hamad I Mohammed)\n""]"

As Formula One returns to the challenging Circuit Gilles Villeneuve for the first time in three years, it will be the 24-year-old Monegasque under most pressure - and probably with much sympathy from a knowledgeable crowd - as he seeks to end a recent run of cruel luck.
Despite taking pole position at the last four races, Leclerc has not won since the third race of the season in Melbourne, six races ago.
Engine failures and strategy mistakes have seen his early lead in the championship become a 34-point deficit.
World champion Max Verstappen, who led Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez home in a commanding one-two in Baku last Sunday (Jun 12), has five wins and 150 points.
He leads Perez, who won in Monaco, on 129 and the luckless Leclerc, winner of the two other races this year, on 116.
Leclerc is set to take a new power unit this Sunday.
After eight successive points finishes, Mercedes new boy George Russell is fourth ahead of Ferrari's Carlos Sainz, who has also endured the Italian team's reliability difficulties.
Another successful weekend for Red Bull could put them in a dominant position in both championships, but team chief Christian Horner warned against complacency and forecast that Ferrari will bounce back into contention.
""They have a very fast car,"" he said. ""Certainly on a Saturday. On Sundays, we have been their equal this year, at most races. And they will sort their problems out - I've no doubt about that.
""There is a long way to go and we've seen big swings in points over the last four or five races. It shows how quickly things can turn.""
Like Leclerc, Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton will also be seeking a revival at a circuit where he has won a record seven times, having claimed his maiden race victory at the Canadian Grand Prix in 2007.
He confirmed this week that despite the acute back pain he suffered on his way to fourth Sunday, he is ready to race again on another notoriously fast and often bumpy circuit.
The seven-time champion is sixth behind Sainz in the title race on 62 points and without a win this season, but has pledged to battle on.
""Sunday was tough and I had some problems sleeping, but have woken up feeling positive,"" he said in a social media post.
""Back is a little sore and bruised, but nothing serious, thankfully.""
He added that he had had acupuncture and physio to ease the problem, exacerbated by the violent ""porpoising"" and bouncing of his car.
""We have to keep fighting,"" he added. ""I'll be there this weekend - I wouldn't miss it for the world.""
Hamilton's complaints about""'porpoising"" were supported by many drivers following last Sunday's contest, including Leclerc, Verstappen, Sainz, Pierre Gasly of AlphaTauri, Russell and Alfa Romeo's Valtteri Bottas.
All want to see action taken to reform the radical aerodynamic rules on health and safety grounds.
Horner risked much wrath and controversy by suggesting that Mercedes had sought to make a big issue of the problems as ""part of the game"" as quoted by The Race.
Russell responded by rejecting Horner's claims.
""You've either got porpoising and the car is hitting the ground or you have to run the car millimetres above the ground and you're smashing the bumps.
""So, whichever way you've got it, it's not great for anyone. Something will happen. There's no doubt about it.""",['18_0'],['\nBumpy ride ahead for Charles Leclerc? (Photo: AFP/Natalia Kolesnikova)\n']
17,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/ferrari-need-bounce-back-canada-returns-2751486,Ferrari need to bounce back as Canada returns,"    Formula One returns to Canada this weekend for the first time since 2019 with Red Bull on a roll and Ferrari needing a big response to the reliability problems that have hammered their title hopes.
No team has won as many times in Montreal as the Italians, the sport's oldest and most glamorous outfit, but the season that began so brightly is turning sour.
Charles Leclerc has taken six poles in eight races, including the last four, but has retired in two of the last three with engine problems and now lags Red Bull's Max Verstappen by 34 points after earlier leading by 46.
After finishing one-two last weekend in Azerbaijan, Red Bull lead Ferrari by 80 points and are going for their sixth successive win.
""We come back from Baku disappointed, from not having scored the amount of points we should have,"" said Ferrari sporting director Inaki Rueda.
""But we bring some positives. We have a very strong performing car, (and) be it in qualifying or in the race we are capable of fighting in every possible scenario. 
""Our reliability is a weak point... and we will address this.""
Ferrari have found a 'short-term fix' for the hydraulics issue that forced Carlos Sainz to retire in Baku but the engine remains under considerable scrutiny after customer teams Alfa Romeo and Haas also suffered retirements in Baku.
A turnaround at a circuit named after the team's late great Gilles Villeneuve will at least provide some respite to all the 'disaster' talk.
Red Bull, meanwhile, are ready to build on their advantage in what will be Verstappen's 150th grand prix since his race debut as a 17-year-old in Australia in 2015.
His team mate Sergio Perez, second in the championship, has now had five top two finishes this season - equalling his tally from the previous 11 years.
""This car is really performing on the street circuits so we are confident we can put together another strong performance this weekend and keep the momentum going at the top,"" said the Mexican.
Canada would normally throw seven times winner Lewis Hamilton into the spotlight but the Mercedes driver has been making headlines recently more for back pains than any track success.
He won in 2019, the last visit before the COVID-19 pandemic forced the next two editions of the race to be cancelled, but the sport has changed the rules since then and once-dominant Mercedes are struggling.
An eighth win for the Briton would be an outright record but that looks like dreamland for a driver whose car is bouncing and bottoming on the straights, even if they are making some headway.
""I think we will still have a package that isn't at the front on merit,"" said the team's head of strategy James Vowles. ""Red Bull and Ferrari will still be the benchmark that we have to compare ourselves to.
""I think, though, that the large gap that you saw in qualifying in Baku perhaps won't be that big in Montreal.""

Hamilton has won seven times in Montreal (in 2007, 2010, 2012, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019), including the first of his career. He holds the record jointly with Ferrari great Michael Schumacher.
Fernando Alonso (2006), Daniel Ricciardo (2014) and Vettel (2013, 2018) have also won in Canada. Ricciardo's first win in F1 was in Montreal. 
The circuit is named after late Ferrari great Gilles Villeneuve. Ferrari have won 12 times in Canada (11 in Montreal), with seven poles and nine fastest laps.
The rain-hit Canadian Grand Prix of 2011 was Formula One's longest race, lasting four hours, four minutes and 39.537 seconds. The safety car was deployed six times, another record.
The circuit is particularly tough on brakes.
Aston Martin's Lance Stroll and Williams' Nicholas Latifi are the current Canadian drivers. Latifi is making a home debut.
RACE WINS
Red Bull have won six of eight races this season. Max Verstappen has won five and team mate Sergio Perez one. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc has won the other two.
Hamilton has a record 103 wins from 296 starts. He has yet to win this year, and his most recent success was in Saudi Arabia last December.
Ferrari have won 240 races since 1950, McLaren 183, Mercedes 124, Williams 115 and Red Bull 81.
POLE POSITION
Leclerc has been on pole six times this year, including the last four in a row, with Perez and Verstappen taking the other two.
Hamilton has a record 103 career poles, most recently qualifying fastest in Saudi Arabia last year.
FASTEST LAP
Leclerc took the fastest lap bonus point in the first three races, Verstappen in Imola and Miami, Perez in Spain and Azerbaijan and McLaren's Lando Norris in Monaco.
POINTS
Verstappen leads Perez by 21 points and is 34 clear of  Leclerc.
Red Bull lead Ferrari by 80 points in the constructors' standings.
Mercedes' George Russell is the only driver to have scored points in every race this year and all in the top five.
MILESTONE
Sunday will be a 150th race start for Verstappen, who made his debut with Toro Rosso (now AlphaTauri) in Australia as a 17-year-old in 2015.
Now 24, he is the youngest F1 driver to rack up 25 wins.
Fernando Alonso set a record in Azerbaijan as the driver to have raced longest in Formula One. The Spaniard, who made his race debut in 2001, broke Michael Schumacher's record of 21 years and three months.

15,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/f1-governing-body-eliminate-porpoising-2751701,F1 governing body to eliminate 'porpoising',"Formula One's governing body FIA on Thursday (Jun 16) said it plans to introduce changes to reduce or eliminate the ""porpoising"" that has affected this season's cars, after Lewis Hamilton suffered severe back pains during Sunday's Azerbaijan Grand Prix.
The ruling body said it had issued a technical directive to teams ahead of this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix laying out the measures it intends to take.
This includes short-term steps like closer scrutiny of planks and skids underneath the car for design and wear as well as the definition of a metric that will set a quantitative limit for how much cars can bounce.
The formula to determine this metric was still being analysed, the FIA said, with teams invited to contribute to the process.
The body is also planning to convene a technical meeting with teams to define measures over the medium term that will reduce the tendency of the cars to ""porpoise"".
Neither measure is expected to be in place for this weekend’s race in Montreal.
""The FIA has decided to intervene following consultation with its doctors in the interests of safety of the drivers,"" the governing body said in a statement.
""In a sport where the competitors are routinely driving at speeds in excess of 300km/h, it is considered that ... excessive fatigue or pain experienced by a driver could have significant consequences should it result in a loss of concentration.” 
F1 introduced a radical rules overhaul this year that has seen cars generate a significant chunk of their downforce from the underside of the floor.
This has led to the ""porpoising"", in which the cars bounce dramatically at high speeds, like the motion of a porpoise through water.
Teams have been affected to a varying degree, with Mercedes and Ferrari among the worst hit.
Hamilton was seen clutching his back as he clambered out of his Mercedes after the race in Baku, with team boss Toto Wolff raising the prospect of the seven-times champion having to miss the Canadian race.
Hamilton, posting on social media on Monday, said he was sore but wouldn't miss the race in Montreal ""for the world”.
Christian Horner, boss of the Red Bull team whose cars don’t seem to be affected by porpoising, suggested after the Baku race that rivals might be overplaying the problem to secure a favourable rule change. ",['15_0'],"['\nFormula One F1 - Canadian Grand Prix - Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, Montreal, Canada - June 16, 2022 Red Bull crew is seen ahead of the Canadian Grand Prix REUTERS/Chris Helgren\n']"

After 127 Formula One starts Magnussen arrives at this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix still chasing a maiden win but the Haas driver sounded more like a world champion than someone who has failed to finish three of his last four races.
The hard-charging Dane had an eye-opening start to his F1 comeback, picking up points in three of his first four races, including a superb fifth place in the season opener in Bahrain.
""Don't ever feel sorry for us,"" Magnussen told Reuters. ""When you get an opportunity through the back door you don't expect it is very easy to enjoy and appreciate it.
""I was expecting Formula One to be a closed chapter in my life. I wasn't even dreaming it. It is more than a dream come true.""
Magnussen's comeback is his second in a career that started with McLaren in 2014 before stalling after a year on the sidelines in 2015.
Informed by email on his birthday that McLaren were casting him aside, he joined Renault at short notice before the start of the 2016 season and moved to U.S.-owned Haas for 2017.
At the end of the 2020 season, Haas parted company with both Magnussen and Romain Grosjean in favour of young guns Mick Schumacher, son of seven-times world champion Michael, and Russian Nikita Mazepin.
Magnussen said he had given up hope of a Formula One comeback until Haas team boss Guenther Steiner offered him the seat of sacked Mazepin.
A second chance and the birth of his first child last year have brought new perspective that not even reliability problems around the team's Ferrari engines and aerodynamic issues that forced governing body FIA to take action on Thursday can shake.
""I don't make the engines,"" shrugged Magnussen, who has scored all 15 of Haas's points this season. ""I can't influence that in any way so there is no sense in worrying about it.""
The 29-year-old Dane has taken a similar approach to ""porpoising"", in which the cars bounce dramatically at high speeds, like the motion of a porpoise through water.
FIA was prompted to act after Lewis Hamilton suffered severe back pains during Sunday's Azerbaijan Grand Prix.
""That is why FIA is there to step in and do the right thing when the teams can't agree which they never can,"" said Magnussen.
""It's been an issue for everyone but at the end of the day we get on with our jobs.""

The governing FIA said the team had replaced the control electronics for a third time, one more than allowed for the season.
They had earlier replaced the internal combustion engine, control electronics and motor generators before the start of practice at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.
Leclerc has retired due to power unit problems in two of the past three races while leading, despite starting from pole position in the last four rounds.
Ferrari said a power unit that failed in Azerbaijan last Sunday was damaged beyond repair and the problem may have been linked to an earlier one at the Spanish Grand Prix.
A spokeswoman said the team were working on ""countermeasures"" to strengthen the package.
Leclerc has plunged from Formula One championship frontrunner after three races to third overall, 34 points adrift of Red Bull's Max Verstappen, after eight of 22 rounds.
The Monegasque told reporters earlier that Canada was not a bad place to take a penalty, given that overtaking is comparatively easy.
Team mate Carlos Sainz also retired from the race in Baku, but with a hydraulics problem that he said was a ""bit weird"" and ""that hadn't been experienced"" for some years.

World championship leader Verstappen was fastest in both sessions at the island Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, setting a time of one minute 15.158 seconds in a sunny first and 1:14.127 in the second that ended just before a downpour.
Sainz was second in the opening session, lapping 0.246 slower than the Dutch driver, but team mate Charles Leclerc pushed him down to third in the later hour.
Double world champion Fernando Alonso was third and fifth respectively for Renault-owned Alpine with Sebastian Vettel fourth in practice two.
The groundhog momentarily diverted attention from  'porpoising', the bouncing effect causing pain for the drivers of some cars and notably Mercedes, when it crossed the track right in front of Sainz in the first practice.
The Spaniard missed the lucky animal by a whisker.
Ferrari are under close scrutiny after a double retirement in Azerbaijan last weekend dealt a big blow to their title challenge.
Leclerc has taken pole position six times in eight races this season, including the last four, and will have a 10 place grid penalty on Sunday after having a number of power unit components replaced.
The governing FIA said Ferrari had fitted a new control electronics to the car in second practice, one more than his allowance for the season. 
Verstappen has won four of the last five races and leads Perez by 21 points, with Leclerc third and a further 13 behind. 
'BRUTAL' STIFFNESS
Mercedes' seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton, a seven-times winner in Canada, was eighth in session one and 13th in the later one.
Team mate George Russell was sixth and seventh and complained of the car's ""brutal"" stiffness.
""Me and George had much different set-ups in P2 just to see if one way works and one way doesn't,"" said Hamilton, who said over the radio that his car was undriveable.
""For me, it was a disaster. It's like the car is getting worse. It's getting more and more unhappy the more we do to it,"" added the Briton to reporters.
""I'm hoping overnight we can try to make some changes but  it's just the fundamentals of the car ... so it's going to be a struggle.""
A discarded paper towel caused a brake fire after becoming lodged in the front right wheel of Esteban Ocon's Alpine, with the Frenchman pitting for it to be removed.

A four-time world champion, Vettel arrived at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve riding a bicycle wearing a white T-shirt sporting a picture of a pipeline with “Stop Mining Tar Sands” at the top and “Canada’s Climate Crime” stencilled along the bottom.
The Aston Martin driver said he will also wear a special helmet for Sunday's race highlighting the issue.
""I think what happens in Alberta is a crime because you chop down a lot of trees and you basically destroy the place just to extract oil and the manner of doing it with the tar sands, mining oil sands, is horrible for nature,” Vettel told reporters during his pre-race news conference on Friday.
""There’s so much science around the topic that fossil fuels are going to end, and living in a time that we do now these things shouldn’t be allowed anymore and they shouldn’t happen.
""So it is just in principal to raise awareness.""
Vettel's protest caught the attention of Alberta politicians who quickly took to social media labelling the German, whose team is sponsored by Saudi Arabia state-owned oil giant Aramco, a hypocrite.
""I have seen a lot of hypocrisy over the years, but this one takes the cake,"" tweeted Alberta's Energy Minister Sonya Savage. ""A race car driver sponsored by Aston Martin, with financing from Saudi Aramco, complaining about the oil sands.
""Saudi Aramco has the largest daily oil production of all companies in the world. It is reputed to be the single largest contributor to global carbon emissions, of any company, since 1965,"" added Savage.
Vettel has linked his name to many causes.
Last year he wore a rainbow-coloured T-shirt in Hungary with the message 'same love' to protest anti-LGBTQ+ legislation and earlier this month said Formula One was now ready to welcome it's first openly gay driver.
But for the father of three, environmental issues are of particular concern, saying he does not want to leave the next generation a destroyed planet.

10,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/unfair-change-f1-rules-one-team-says-horner-2754941,"Unfair to change F1 rules for one team, says Horner","MONTREAL :     Formula One's governing body should make sure Mercedes have a safer car rather than changing the rules for everyone, Red Bull boss Christian Horner suggested on Friday.
Horner told Reuters at the Canadian Grand Prix that soaring inflation and energy costs were a more pressing problem than 'porpoising', the bouncing phenomenon suffered in its most extreme by Mercedes. 
He said an FIA technical directive sent to the teams on Thursday and setting out measures to be taken on safety grounds would be hard to police, and questioned why it was even necessary.
""It seems very unfair at this point of the year when there’s only really one team that’s missed the target,"" said Horner in a clear reference to the struggling champions.
""Is it right to change everything for that one team or should the one team change to get itself more in line?,"" he asked.
""Personally I would put the emphasis on the team to get itself together.""
Mercedes' seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton told reporters after last weekend's Azerbaijan Grand Prix that it had been his toughest race and he had got through it with gritted teeth.
Horner, whose team have won six of eight races and are leading both championships, suggested then that some might be over-playing the problems to secure a favourable rule change on safety grounds.
""I'd tell them to bitch as much as they could and make as big an issue out of it as they possibly could,"" he had said when asked what he would tell his drivers if they suffered from similar bouncing.
Horner said that if the FIA wanted to intervene on safety grounds it could always disqualify a dangerous car by having a black flag waved.
'COLLABORATIVE APPROACH'
Horner added that more consultation between teams and the FIA was needed and ""a bit more of a collaborative approach"".
""I don’t know who dictates what your rear ride height is, for example,"" he said of the directive. ""Or what level of porpoising is acceptable and what isn’t ... if the wind changes, it has an effect. How do you police it?
""We’re not saying it’s the wrong thing to do, we’re just saying that perhaps it needs a little more discussion before implementation.""
Horner has been vocal about raising the budget cap above the current $140 million to counter the effects of inflation, with energy costs soaring. 
He warned as many as seven of the 10 teams risked breaching spending limits.
The Bank of England has warned that the country's rate of inflation will exceed 11 per cent later in the year.
""You see interest rates going up and you see inflation increasing. That is by far the biggest issue that needs to be addressed imminently, I would say,"" added Horner.
""I think we’ve genuinely got a force majeure situation. Hopefully something will be done in the next week or two.
""The cap needs to retain its credibility ... but we've got an extraordinary set of circumstances this year.""

9,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/hamilton-high-fourth-canada-qualifying-2755881,Hamilton on a high with fourth in Canada qualifying,"MONTREAL :Seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton was ecstatic after fourth place in Canadian Grand Prix qualifying raised the Mercedes driver's hopes of returning to the Formula One podium.
The Briton has struggled all year with a bouncing car that he described on Friday as a disaster but, in wet conditions, he produced his best Saturday performance in nine races.
""I can't tell you how happy I am,"" Hamilton told reporters. ""Me and Ange (physio Angela Cullen) had the biggest hug at the back of the garage because we've both been working so hard.
""On pure pace in the dry we're still a long way off but to get top four in qualifying in those conditions is awesome.
""It feels very very similar to my first qualifying in Australia 2007 in terms of excitement.""
Mercedes, dominant for the past eight years, have been off the pace of rivals Red Bull and Ferrari with a car they have yet to tame.
The governing FIA issued a technical directive on Thursday aimed at reducing for safety reasons the bouncing that raised particular concern in Azerbaijan last weekend.
Mercedes tried a modification on Friday but said a stiffening stay was not effective and would not be used again.
Rivals were already gearing up for a fight, with Alpine boss Otmar Szafnauer suggesting Mercedes could be protested and asking how they had been able to produce the part so quickly when others could not.
Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff took part in what he described as a ""feisty"" meeting of his fellow principals with tempers reportedly flaring.
""It's all fair that we're having political fights about performance gains, but I think that some of them are taking it too lightly when you look at drivers' health,"" he told Sky Sports television.
""I think in Baku it was definitely too dangerous to run these cars. Every single one suffered and you could see that the bottoming on the straight was quite dangerous. We saw it yesterday here too.""
Hamilton's qualifying was a sharp contrast to Friday when he had detected no progress.
""It seems a lot of things we try on this car struggle to work,"" he said then.
""It's not the Montreal that I'm used to and that I've driven throughout my career, it's the worst I've felt any car here.""

8,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/stop-complaining-and-drive-says-alphatauri-boss-2755921,"Stop complaining and drive, says AlphaTauri boss","MONTREAL :     As Formula One wrestles with 'porpoising' problems that have left some drivers battered and bruised, AlphaTauri boss Franz Tost suggested on Saturday that if conditions are too tough in the cockpit there is always a comfortable couch at home.
Driver health has been put in the spotlight at the Canadian Grand Prix with teams told to put safety before performance and address the problem of cars bouncing dramatically at high speeds.
Concern reached new levels last weekend at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix when seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton struggled to get out of his Mercedes at the end of a punishing race.
Tost, whose drivers are Frenchman Pierre Gasly and Japan's Yuki Tsunoda, said he understood cars were difficult to drive but offered little sympathy.
""These are Formula One cars, this is not a Rolls Royce and drivers should be aware about this,"" said the Austrian, before the cars took to a rainy Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on Saturday for final practice and qualifying.
""If the cars are too stiff, it's too difficult for them (the drivers) maybe they should stay at home, in the living room sitting in a chair and they can do their races.""
Porpoising has become the newest F1 flash point with the governing FIA wading in on Thursday with a technical directive of measures to reduce or eliminate the problem. It said it had done so in the interest of driver safety.
Tost and Alpine team principle Otmar Szafnauer argued that it was not really a safety issue.
""It was clear from the very beginning that these cars would not be easy to drive,"" said Tost. ""This floor makes it necessary that cars are set up stiff, that the cars are quite close to surface. 
""The cars aren't anymore as comfortable to drive as they were in the past.
""Now the drivers complain about it. I can understand it is not so easy for them, on the other hand this is a Formula One car not a Rolls Royce.""
Tost recalled a time when drivers would come to him after a race saying they needed to see a dentist because the ride was so jarring.
The AlphaTauri boss suggested maybe a little more time in the gym and a bit less complaining might help.
""Drivers must do more training for their neck muscles - this helps for sure,"" added Tost. ""And the FIA is coming now with this technical directive which of course will help to find out how big are the forces.
""How much this can be controlled we don't know yet.""

AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly was second, 0.053 slower than Alonso's one minute 33.836 seconds, and ahead of Aston Martin's Sebastian Vettel in the cold conditions, with wet tyres used for most of the hour-long session.
Red Bull's championship leader Max Verstappen, winner of four of the last five races, was ninth fastest but did only 10 laps compared to Alonso's 15 and went off track a couple of times without damage.
Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, set to start at the back of the grid due to penalties for power unit component changes, did not set a time at all from five installation laps.

Ferrari's Carlos Sainz was third fastest on a drying track and seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton fourth for Mercedes on a weekend dominated by talk of 'porpoising', or bouncing, cars.
""I still expect it not to be a straightforward race,"" said Verstappen after the Dutch driver's second pole in nine races this season. ""But today with the tricky conditions we stayed calm and didn't make mistakes.
""I'm super happy to get pole position and to be back in Montreal.""
His qualifying time of one minute 21.299 seconds was 0.645 faster than Alonso's best.
Sunday's race at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve will be the first in Canada since 2019 and the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is forecast to take place in sunny and dry conditions.
Verstappen has won four of the last five races and leads team mate Sergio Perez by 21 points, with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc a further 13 behind.
Double world champion Alonso, the oldest man on the grid at 40, had been fastest in the day's final practice and said with a grin that he planned to attack Verstappen into the first corner.
Leclerc, on pole in the last four races, will start at the back after collecting engine penalties.
BIG POTENTIAL
Haas's Kevin Magnussen qualified fifth with team mate Mick Schumacher a career highest sixth. Alpine's Esteban Ocon lines up seventh and Mercedes' George Russell eighth.
""It's something I can build on and grow from. I always loved racing in the wet conditions. On a track like this, there's big potential for drivers showing what they can do,"" said Schumacher.
McLaren's Daniel Ricciardo qualified ninth and Chinese rookie Zhou Guanyu lines up 10th for Alfa Romeo.
Qualifying was halted in the second phase when Perez went straight into the Tecpro barrier between turns three and four and could not reverse out.
The car had to be craned off and the barriers repaired before the session resumed.
Perez qualified 13th, one place ahead of McLaren's Lando Norris who failed to set a time in the second stage after reporting an issue with the power unit that the team were unable to fix.
Williams' Alex Albon had also gone into the barriers at turn six earlier but was able to continue, returning to the pits for a new front wing and eventually qualifying 12th.
Aston Martin's four times world champion Sebastian Vettel and Canadian Lance Stroll failed to progress from the wet opening phase, with Verstappen fastest, after they had raised hopes in final practice.

5,Formula 1,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/alonso-back-front-after-decade-behind-2756246,Alonso back up front after a decade behind ,"MONTREAL :     Only four current Formula One drivers were around last time Fernando Alonso started a race on the front row but, a decade on, the double-world champion was back with a bang on Saturday.
He qualified second in Canada alongside Red Bull's pole-sitter and championship leader Max Verstappen.
The Spaniard's Alpine team mate Esteban Ocon was still far from Formula One when Alonso, now nearly 41, made his last appearance at the sharp end with pole for Ferrari at the 2012 German Grand Prix.
The only other drivers in that race still competing are seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton, Sergio Perez, Daniel Ricciardo and Sebastien Vettel.
A generation who grew up hearing what Alonso was capable of saw him roll back the years at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve where he won in 2006.
The hard-charging Spaniard has not forgotten what to do - attack.
""The goal is to lead the race,"" said Alonso. ""Turn one maximum attack. It would be nice and sweet to lead the race.""
While Alonso flashed plenty of bravado he was also realistic that his chances of coming away with victory on Sunday were slim.
His superb qualifying effort came on a rainy windswept afternoon while the race is expected to take place in dry conditions that will favour top teams Red Bull and Ferrari.
""I am not sure about out possibilities tomorrow, I would say realistically top five is what we should fight for,"" said Alonso, whose best results this season are a pair of seventh place finishes at Monaco and Azerbaijan.
""We know our expectations...I think the top four places are locked. So fifth is like a win for us and that is probably the spot we should take.
""To think about wins is fairly unrealistic.""
If Alonso has one big advantage it is experience of the tricky island circuit that has not hosted a race since 2019 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""There is kerb riding here and it is quite bumpy, (these) are things you know after many, many years,"" said Alonso. ""I've been racing here 16, 17 years and I always said age and experience is always a help.""

The 24-year-old Dutch driver took his 26th career win 0.9 of a second ahead of Spaniard Sainz, who closed the gap and set up a thrilling final chase thanks to a safety car deployment.
Seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton completed the podium for Mercedes in a remarkable turnaround for the Briton,  who had dismissed his bouncing car as undriveable only days earlier.
Sainz collected the bonus point for fastest lap as the Italian team trimmed the gap to runaway leaders Red Bull in the constructors' championship to 76 points from a previous 80.
""It was really exciting at the end. I was giving it everything I had and, of course, Carlos was doing the same,"" said Verstappen after his sixth win of the season and Red Bull's sixth in succession.
""I could see he was pushing and charging, but when you're on the DRS (drag reduction system) it's a lot easier to charge. The last few laps were a lot of fun.""
The victory was his first in Canada.
Sainz, who had fresher tyres than Verstappen, said he had tried everything he could to end his long wait for a first win  at a circuit named after Canada's late Ferrari great Gilles Villeneuve.
""We were very, very close to winning today. I will take the positives and keep trying in the next one,"" he added.
HAMILTON OVERWHELMED
Hamilton said the result, with team mate George Russell fourth, was ""quite overwhelming"" and gave him and the team a lot of hope for the rest of the season. 
It was his first podium since third place in Bahrain in the opening race.
""It's been such a battle this year with the car, but we continue to stay vigilant, focused and never giving up, and that's something I'm proud of,"" he said.
""We're getting closer, so we've got to keep pushing and hopefully we'll eventually be in the fight with these guys."" 
Verstappen's Mexican team mate Sergio Perez, who remains second overall, retired and triggered a virtual safety car after just eight of the 70 scheduled laps when his car became stuck in gear. 
Ferrari's Charles Leclerc started 19th after engine penalties and ended the day fifth, but now 49 points behind Verstappen.
Verstappen had led the field away from pole position, with Alpine's double world champion Fernando Alonso alongside on the front row after a wet Saturday qualifying but unable to make good on his threat to seize the lead into the first corner.
The 40-year-old Spaniard was passed by Sainz on lap three and finished the race seventh, behind team mate Esteban Ocon in sixth, but was demoted to ninth after stewards handed him a five second post-race penalty for weaving on track.
Valtteri Bottas, who was slowed by Alonso's robust defence,  moved up to seventh for Alfa Romeo with Chinese team mate Guanyu Zhou eighth.
Canadian Lance Stroll took the final point for Aston Martin on a sunny afternoon.
HAAS BLOW 
There was disappointment for Haas after Kevin Magnussen and Mick Schumacher lined up fifth and sixth on the grid but failed to score.
Magnussen had to pit to replace a damaged front wing on lap seven and Schumacher, still chasing his first point in Formula One, slowed and retired on lap 19.
That triggered the second virtual safety car of the afternoon, with Sainz pitting from the lead he had inherited when he stayed out during the Perez incident while Verstappen came in for fresh tyres.
The real safety car was deployed after AlphaTauri's Yuki Tsunoda went into the barriers on lap 48, with Sainz making his second stop and keeping Verstappen in his sights ready to attack over the last 16 laps.

Whenever the F1 circus pitches its tent in a city, the drivers roll out well-rehearsed platitudes but there has always been a sense of sincerity when it comes to the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, a high-speed track on the man-made Ile Notre-Dame in the middle of the St. Lawrence river.
""It's such a great place, obviously, one of my favourite tracks, one of the old-school ones that remains in the calendar and that's pretty special,"" said Alpine's Esteban Ocon. ""It's awesome to see that the city transforms completely to racing mode.""
While drivers missed the Canadian Grand Prix, local businesses were left heartbroken.
The race is not just one of Canada's best-attended sporting events but has grown into a week-long festival of high-octane fun that has super-charged the Montreal area economy.
The Société du parc Jean-Drapeau, Tourisme Montréal and the Formula 1 Grand Prix du Canada published a study earlier this year, according to the CBC, that found the event's economic impact on the gross domestic product (GDP) to be $63.2 million (CDN).
Interest in this year's race exploded after the NetFlix documentary series ""Drive To Survive"" provided a behind-the-scenes insight into F1's personalities and rivalries - with people locked down during the COVID-19 pandemic binge watching the episodes.
""You can feel that the people love Formula One; you can see that there are many Formula One fans,"" said AlphaTuari team principal Franz Tost. ""Of course, this is part of the history. 
""Canada has a fantastic Formula One history with Gilles Villeneuve and with other Formula One drivers.""
Mother Nature did not exactly welcome F1 back to Montreal as Friday practice and Saturday qualifying were buffeted by lightning storms and lashing rain.
But the weather for Sunday's race was near perfect, giving the sellout crowd a good return on their pricey investment as Red Bull's championship leader Max Verstappen held off a challenge from Ferrari's Carlos Sainz to extend his advantage in the standings.
Race fans blocked out worries of sky-rocketing gas prices and inflation as they opened their wallets to secure a seat at the circuit. 
Tickets for Sunday's race on resale sites were not for the faint hearted, with general admission going for over $500 while VIP suites topped $10,000.
Hotels were also cashing in with rooms averaging more than $500 a night while AirBnB were asking from $1,000 to $4,000 a day for a downtown condo.
Restaurants and bars, especially those operating on pedestrian-only streets like Crescent and Peel were party central with the fun lasting well into the early morning.
""I wasn't going to miss this,"" said Tom from Toronto, who admitted to nursing hangover as he made his way to the track on Sunday. ""I've spent enough to buy a car but it's worth it.""

His sixth win from nine races - and Red Bull's sixth success in a row and seventh in all this season - suggests the 24-year-old Dutch driver is cruising towards his second successive championship.
Verstappen insisted he had won, in his 150th race, despite not being fastest, however.
""It's still a very long way,"" he said after a race heavily influenced by a late safety car that brought Ferrari's Carlos Sainz back into play on fresher tyres and with 16 laps of racing remaining. 
""I know the gap of course is quite big, but I also know that it can switch around very quickly. I mean, (after) race three I was 46 behind, so we just need to stay calm, we need to focus and we need to improve because today we're not the quickest.
""It swings a bit, like last weekend (in Azerbaijan) it looked good in the race, now it didn't look as good but we still managed to win and that I think is also a quality.""
Verstappen, who leads his own team mate Sergio Perez, also had to contend with a radio that stopped working.
Red Bull have only once before racked up six successive wins, with four times world champion Sebastian Vettel managing a run of nine in 2013, and Ferrari will be doing their best to stop it stretching to seven.
Spaniard Sainz did his best, chasing Verstappen to the chequered flag for second place, but the Italian team were hampered by having Charles Leclerc start on the back row after engine penalties.
Leclerc, who held that 46 point lead after winning two of the season's first three races, still came through the field to finish fifth.
""It was a tough race. I mean, I expected to have a little bit more pace. But we seemed to lack a little bit compared to Carlos,"" said Verstappen.

Mercedes' seven times world champion said the result, after severe back pain in Azerbaijan a week earlier in a bouncing car he had also described as undriveable after Friday practice in Montreal, filled him with hope.
""It feels incredible today to be in amongst the battle,"" the Briton said after finishing behind Red Bull's championship-leading winner Max Verstappen and Ferrari's Carlos Sainz.
He described the outcome of his afternoon as ""quite overwhelming.""
""I was kind of just about keeping up with these guys, but they pulled away at the end. But it has given me and the team a lot of hope that there's more to come from this car. The potential is truly there if we get the set-up right.""
Hamilton had not been on the podium since he was also third in the season-opener in Bahrain in March, also the last time he finished ahead of new team mate George Russell who was fourth on Sunday.
During the week he told reporters that the car was a disaster and ""whatever we do to improve it just makes it more unhappy"".
Canada has always been a happy place for Hamilton, however, the circuit providing a backdrop to his first grand prix victory with McLaren in 2007, and he had qualified fourth in wet conditions.
The Briton has won seven times in Canada, a record he shares with Ferrari great Michael Schumacher, and while form suggested another was not on the cards there were moments when the fans must have begun to wonder.
Hamilton said the team had tried two different avenues in practice, and the one he went down was dreadful so they collated the data and made some drastic changes. The outcome was reassuring.
""To be back up there and experience the energy from the crowd was very reminiscent of that first year here,"" he mused after the race. ""I’m so, so happy.""
Asked how his back was feeling after the scare of Azerbaijan and a week of treatment, the 37-year-old replied: ""It's good.

Teams in championship order:
RED BULL (Max Verstappen 1, Sergio Perez retired)
Verstappen started on pole position, pitted twice and took his sixth win of the season, first in Canada and career 26th. The victory was Red Bull's sixth in a row and he did it with a broken radio. Perez started 13th and retired on lap eight with a gearbox failure. It was his first blank since the opener in Bahrain but he stays second, 46 points behind Verstappen.
FERRARI (Carlos Sainz 2, Charles Leclerc 5)
Sainz led after Verstappen pitted in the first virtual safety car (VSC) period on lap nine. He pitted again during the  second VSC on lap 19. The late safety car on lap 48 put him back in contention, chasing Verstappen to the finish on fresh tyres and setting the fastest lap. Leclerc started 19th after engine penalties and worked through the field on a one-stop strategy. Ferrari closed the gap at the top to 76 points from 80.
MERCEDES (Lewis Hamilton 3, George Russell 4)
Hamilton started fourth on the grid, stopped on lap nine and again on lap 44 for a surprise first podium since Bahrain. He made contact with Magnussen on the opening lap, without damage. It was the first time since March he finished ahead of Russell, who started eighth.
MCLAREN (Daniel Ricciardo 11, Lando Norris 15)
No points for McLaren, who remained fourth overall and eight clear of Alpine. Norris started 14th but collected a five second time penalty for speeding in the pit lane. Ricciardo was ninth on the grid. Both pitted on lap 19 and 49. 
ALPINE (Esteban Ocon 6, Fernando Alonso 9)
Alonso started alongside Verstappen, his first front row since 2012 when he was at Ferrari, and finished seventh before a five second penalty for weaving while defending against Bottas demoted the Spaniard to ninth. Alonso also had a suspected air leak. Ocon started seventh and helped Alonso stay ahead of Bottas with an aerodynamic tow in the final laps.
ALFA ROMEO (Valtteri Bottas 7, Guanyu Zhou 8)
Both drivers moved up after Alonso's penalty. The result was Zhou's best so far and his second scoring finish of the season, keeping the team six points behind Alpine.
ALPHATAURI (Pierre Gasly 14, Yuki Tsunoda retired)
Tsunoda started last due to a power unit change and brought out the safety car on lap 48 when he pushed too hard at the pit lane exit and ended up in the wall. Gasly pitted on lap five but his car was lacking grip and sliding around.
ASTON MARTIN (Lance Stroll 10, Sebastian Vettel 12)
Stroll started 17th on a one-stop strategy, with a very long first stint on the hard tyres. He then passed Ricciardo for the final point. Vettel started 16th and stopped twice, letting Stroll through to attack Ricciardo.
HAAS (Kevin Magnussen 17, Mick Schumacher retired)
What had started out so promisingly ended with nothing. Magnussen started fifth and Schumacher sixth but the latter's  hopes of his first points vanished when he retired with a power unit problem on lap 19. Magnussen's race was compromised by the collision with Hamilton and having to pit for a new front wing.

Albon started 12th. Latifi 18th
